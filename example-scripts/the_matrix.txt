ON COMPUTER SCREEN

so close it has no boundaries.

A blinding cursor pulses in the electric darkness like a
heart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath
the derma of black-neon glass.

A PHONE begins to RING, we hear it as though we were
making the call.  The cursor continues to throb,
relentlessly patient, until --

       Yeah?

                 MAN (V.O.)

Data now slashes across the screen, information flashing
faster then we can read:  "Call trans opt:  received.
2-19-98 13:24:18  REC:Log>."

                 WOMAN (V.O.)
       Is everything in place?

On screen:  "Trace program:  running."

We listen to the phone conversation as though we were on
a third line.  The man's name is Cypher.  The woman,
Trinity.

                        TRINITY (WOMANV.O.)
       I said, is everything in place?

The entire screen with racing columns of numbers.
Shimmering like green-electric rivers, they rush at a
10-digit phone number in the top corner.

                 CYPHER (MANV.O.)
       You weren't supposed to relieve
       me.

                 TRINITY (V.O.)
       I know but I felt like taking a
       shift.

The area code is identified.  The first three numbers
suddenly fixed, leaving only seven flowing columns.

                 CYPHER (V.O.)
       You like him, don't you?  You like
       watching him?

We begin MOVING TOWARD the screen, CLOSING IN as each
digit is matched, one by one, snapping into place like
the wheels of a slot machine.

                 TRINITY (V.O.)
       Don't be ridiculous.

                 CYPHER (V.O.)
       We're going to kill him.  Do you
       understand that?  He's going to
       die just like the others.

                 TRINITY (V.O.)
       Morpheus believes he is the One.

Only two thin digits left.

       Do you?

                 CYPHER (V.O.)

                 TRINITY (V.O.)
       I... it doesn't matter what I
       believe.

                 CYPHER (V.O.)
       You don't, do you?

                 TRINITY (V.O.)
       If you have something to say, I
       suggest you say it to Morpheus.

                 CYPHER (V.O.)
       I intend to, believe me.  Someone
       has to.

The final NUMBER POPS into place --

                 TRINITY (V.O.)
       Did you hear that?

       Hear what?

                 CYPHER (V.O.)

On screen:  "Trace complete.  Call origin:  #312-555-
0690.

                 TRINITY (V.O.)
       Are you sure this line is clean?

                 CYPHER (V.O.)
       Yeah, 'course I'm sure.

We MOVE STILL CLOSER, the ELECTRIC HUM of the green
NUMBERS GROWING into an ominous ROAR.

       I better go.

                 TRINITY (V.O.)

She hangs up as we PASS THROUGH the numbers, entering the
nether world of the computer screen.  Suddenly, a flash-
light cuts open the darkness and we find ourselves in --

INT. HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL - NIGHT

The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way
across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms
as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling, leaving
patterns of permanent shadow.

We FOLLOW four armed POLICE OFFICERS using flashlights as
they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves
on either side of Room 303.

The biggest of them violently kicks in the door.  The other
cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before them.

                 BIG COP
       Police!  Freeze!

The room is almost devoid of furniture.  There is a fold-
up table and chair with a phone, a modem, and a powerbook
computer.  The only light in the room is the glow of the
computer.

Sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is
TRINITY; a woman in black leather.

                 BIG COP
       Hands behind your head!  Now!  Do
       it!

She slowly puts her hands behind her head.

A black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the
police cruisers.  AGENT SMITH, AGENT BROWN, and AGENT
JONES get out of the car.

They wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night.  They
are also always hardwired; small Secret Service earphones
in one ear, the cord coiling back into their shirt
collars.

       Lieutenant?

       Oh shit.

                 AGENT SMITH

                 AGENT SMITH
       Lieutenant, you were given
       specific orders --

                 LIEUTENANT
       I'm just doing my job.  You gimme
       that Juris-my dick-tion and you
       can cram it up your ass.

                 AGENT SMITH
       The orders were for your
       protection.

The Lieutenant laughs.

                 LIEUTENANT
       I think we can handle one little
       girl.

Agent Smith nods to Agent Brown as they start toward the
hotel.

                 LIEUTENANT
       I sent two units.  They're
       bringing her down now.

                 AGENT SMITH
       No, Lieutenant, your men are
       already dead.

The Big Cop flicks out his cuffs, the other cops holding
a bead.  They've done this a hundred times, they know
they've got her, until the Big Cop reaches with the cuffs
and Trinity moves --

It almost doesn't register, so smooth and fast, inhumanly
fast.

The eye blinks and Trinity's palm snaps up and the nose
explodes, blood erupting.  Her leg kicks with the force
of a wrecking ball and he flies back, a two-hundred-fifty
pound sack of limp meat and bone that slams into the cop
farthest from her.

Trinity moves again, BULLETS RAKING the walls,
flashlights sweeping with panic as the remaining cops try
to stop a leather-clad ghost.

A GUN still in the cop's hand is snatched, twisted, and
FIRED.  There is a final violent exchange of GUNFIRE and
when it's over, Trinity is the only one standing.

Agent Brown enters the hotel while Agent Smith heads for
the alley.

INT. HEART O' THE CITY HOTEL

Trinity is on the phone, pacing.  The other end is
answered.

       Operator.

                 MAN (V.O.)

                 TRINITY
       Morpheus!  The line was traced!  I
       don't know how.

                        MORPHEUS (MANV.O.)
       I know.  They cut the hardline.
       This line is not a viable exit.

                 TRINITY
       Are there any Agents?

       Yes.

       Goddamnit!

                 MORPHEUS (V.O.)

                 TRINITY

                 MORPHEUS (V.O.)
       You have to focus.  There is a
       phone.  Wells and Lake.  You can
       make it.

She takes a deep breath, centering herself.

       All right --

                 TRINITY

       Go.

She drops the phone.

                 MORPHEUS (V.O.)

INT. HALL

She bursts out of the room as Agent Brown enters the
hall, leading another unit of police.  Trinity races to
the opposite end, exiting through a broken window onto
the fire escape.

EXT. FIRE ESCAPE

In the alley below, Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at
her.  She can only go up.

EXT. ROOF

On the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over
the parapet, leading the cops in pursuit.

Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her
movements so clean, gliding in and out of each jump,
contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops.

Agent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace.

The roof falls away into a wide back alley.  The next
building is over 40 feet away, but Trinity's face is
perfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other roof.

                 COP
       That's it, we got her now.

The cops slow, realizing they are about to see something
ugly as Trinity drives at the edge, launching herself
into the air.

From above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as she
hangs in flight, then hits, somersaulting up, still
running hard.

                 COP
       Jesus Christ -- that's impossible!

They stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the move
exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder up onto one knee.

It is a dizzying chase up and over the dark plateaued
landscape of rooftops and sheer cliffs of brick.  Ahead,
she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point where
her path drops away into a paved chasm, there is!--

EXT. WINDOW

A yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick building.

Trinity zeros in on it, running as hard as she can and --

Hurtles herself into the empty night space, her body
leveling into a dive.  She falls, arms covering her head
as the whole world seems to spin on its axis --

A10

INT. BACK STAIRWELL

A10

And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then
falls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down
stairs bleeding, broken --

But still alive.

She wheels on the smashed opening above, her gun
instantly in her hand, trained, waiting for Agent Brown
but is met by only a slight WIND that HISSES against the
fanged maw of broken glass.

Trinity tries to move.  Everything hurts.

                 TRINITY
       Get up, Trinity.  You're fine.
       Get up -- just get up!

She stands and limps down the rest of the stairs.

EXT. STREET

11

Trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and, at the
end of the block, in a pool of white street light, she
sees it!--

The telephone booth.

Obviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk,
focusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the PHONE
begins to RING.

Across the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, it's
TIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates.  Trinity sees the
headlights of the truck arcing at the telephone booth as
if taking aim.

Gritting through the pain, she races the truck, slamming
into the booth, the headlights blindingly bright, bearing
down on the box of Plexiglas just as --

She answers the phone.

There is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking
mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk --

Barreling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick
wall, SMASHING it to PLEXIGLAS PULP.

After a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab of
the garbage truck.  Agent Smith inspects the wreckage.
There is no body.  Trinity is gone.

His jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration.
Agent Jones and Brown walk up behind him.

       She got out.

                 AGENT JONES

                 AGENT SMITH
       It doesn't matter.

                 AGENT BROWN
       The informant is real.

Agent Smith almost smiles.

       Yes.

                 AGENT SMITH

                 AGENT JONES
       We have the name of their next target.

                 AGENT BROWN
       The name is Neo.

The handset of the pay phone lays on the ground, separated
in the crash like a severed limb.

                 AGENT SMITH
       We'll need a search running.

                 AGENT JONES
       It's already begun.

We are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER
and CLOSER, until the smooth gray plastic spreads out
like a horizon and the small holes widen until we FALL
THROUGH one --

Swallowed by DARKNESS.

The DARKNESS CRACKLES with phosphorescent energy, the
word "searching" blazing in around us as we EMERGE FROM a
computer screen.

The screen flickers with windowing data as a search
engine runs with a steady relentless rhythm.

We DRIFT BACK FROM the screen and INTO --

INT. NEO'S APARTMENT

                                      9.

12

It is a studio apartment that seems overgrown with
technology.

Weed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into
thickets that wind up and around the legs of several
desks.  Tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment
that lay open like an autopsied corpse.

At the center of this technological rat-nest is NEO, a
man who knows more about living inside a computer than
outside one.

He is asleep in front of his PC.  Behind him, the
computer screen suddenly goes blank.  A prompt appears:
"Wake up, Neo."

Neo's eye pries open.  He sits up, one eye still closed,
looking around, unsure of where he is.  He notices the
screen.

He types "CTRL X" but the letter "T" appears.

       What...?

                 NEO

He hits another and an "H" appears.  He keeps typing,
pushing random functions and keys while the computer
types out a message as though it had a mind of its own.

He stops and stares at the four words on the screen:
"The Matrix has you."

       What the hell?

                 NEO

He hits the "ESC" button.  Another message appears:
"Follow the white rabbit."

He hits it again and the message repeats.  He rubs his
eyes but when he opens them, there is another message:
"Knock, knock, Neo."

Someone KNOCKS on his door and he almost jumps out of his
chair.  He looks back at the computer, but the screen is
now blank.

Someone KNOCKS again.  Neo rises, still unnerved.

       Who is it?

       It's Choi.

                 NEO

                 CHOI (O.S)

Neo flips a series of locks and opens the door, leaving
the chain on.  A young Chinese MAN stands there with
several of his friends.

                 NEO
       You're two hours late.

                 CHOI (MAN)
       I know.  It's her fault.

                 NEO
       You got the money?

       Two grand.

                 CHOI

He takes out an envelope and gives it to Neo through the
cracked door.

       Hold on.

                 NEO

He closes the door.  On the floor near his bed is a book,
Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulations.  The book has
been hollowed out and inside are several computer disks.
He takes one, sticks the money in the book and drops it
on the floor.

Opening the door, he hands the disk to Choi.

                 CHOI
       Hallelujah!  You are my Savior,
       man!  My own personal Jesus
       Christ!

                 NEO
       If you get caught using that --

                 CHOI
       I know, I know.  This never
       happened.  You don't exist.

       Right...

                 NEO

Neo nods as the strange feeling of unrealness suddenly
returns.

                 CHOI
       Something wrong, man?  You look a
       little whiter than usual.

                 NEO
       I don't know... My computer...

He looks back at Choi, unable to explain what just
happened.

                 NEO
       You ever have the feeling that
       you're not sure if you're awake or
       still dreaming?

                 CHOI
       All the time.  It's called
       mescaline and it is the only way
       to fly.

He smiles and slaps the hand of his nearest droog.

                 CHOI
       It sounds to me like you need to
       unplug, man.  A little R&R.  What
       do you think, Dujour, should we
       take him with us?

       Definitely.

                 DUJOUR

                 NEO
       I can't.  I have to work tomorrow.

                 DUJOUR
       Come on.  It'll be fun.  I
       promise.

He looks up at her and suddenly notices on her black
leather motorcycle jacket dozens of pins:  bands,
symbols, slogans, military medals and --

A small white rabbit.  The ROOM TILTS.

                 NEO
       Yeah, yeah.  Sure, I'll go.

INT. APARTMENT

13

An older apartment; a series of halls connects a chain of
small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy casements.

Smoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there
are.

Dressed predominately in black, people are everywhere,
gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like
jungle cats around a tree.

Neo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle
of beer, feeling completely out of place.  He is about to
leave when he notices a woman staring at him.

The woman is Trinity.  She walks straight up to him.

In the nearest room, shadow-like figures grind against
each other to the pneumatic beat of INDUSTRIAL MUSIC.

       Hello, Neo.

                 TRINITY

                 NEO
       How do you know that name?

                 TRINITY
       I know a lot about you.  I've been
       wanting to meet you for some time.

       Who are you?

                 NEO

                 TRINITY
       My name is Trinity.

                 NEO
       Trinity?  The Trinity?  The
       Trinity that cracked the I.R.S.
       D-Base?

                 TRINITY
       That was a long time ago.

       Gee-zus.

       What?

                 NEO

                 TRINITY

                 NEO
       I just thought... you were a guy.

       Most guys do.

                 TRINITY

Neo is a little embarrassed.

                 NEO
       Do you want to go somewhere and
       talk?

                 TRINITY
       No.  It's safe here and I don't
       have much time.

The MUSIC is so LOUD they must stand very close, talking
directly into each other's ear.

                 NEO
       That was you on my computer?

She nods.

                 NEO
       How did you do that?

                 TRINITY
       Right now, all I can tell you, is
       that you are in danger.  I brought
       you here to warn you.

       Of what?

                 NEO

                 TRINITY
       They're watching you, Neo.

       Who is?

                 NEO

                 TRINITY
       Please.  Just listen.  I know why
       you're here, Neo.  I know what
       you've been doing.  I know why you
       hardly sleep, why you live alone
       and why, night after night, you
       sit at your computer.  You're
       looking for him.

Her body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.

                 TRINITY
       I know because I was once looking
       for the same thing, but when he
       found me he told me I wasn't
       really looking for him.  I was
       looking for an answer.

There is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels
the words, like a drug, seeping into him.

She leans close, her lips almost touching his ear.

       The answer is out there, Neo.
       It's looking for you and it will
       find you, if you want it to.

She turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall
of bodies.

A SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the MUSIC,

Neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding
outside, dragging their rubber squeegees down the surface
of the glass.

                 RHINEHEART
       You have a problem with authority,
       Mr. Anderson.  You believe that
       you are special, that somehow the

       This company is one of the top

       has a problem, the company has a
       problem.

He turns again.

       The time has come to make a
       choice, Mr. Anderson.  Either you
       choose to be at your desk on time
       from this day forth, or you choose
       to find yourself another job.  Do

labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of
elevators.

Neo turns and finds a FEDERAL EXPRESS GUY at his cubicle
door.

                 NEO
       Yeah.  That's me.

Neo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex Guy hands him
the softpak.

                 FEDEX GUY
       Have a nice day.

He opens the bag.  Inside is a cellular PHONE.  It seems

flips it open.

Neo's knees give and he sinks into his chair.

       Morpheus...

                 NEO

                 MORPHEUS (V.O.)
       I've been looking for you, Neo.  I
       don't know if you're ready to see
       what I want to show you, but
       unfortunately, we have run out of
       time.  They're coming for you,

       they're going to do.

                 NEO

Neo starts to stand.

       Do it slowly.  The elevator.

His head peeks up over the partition.  At the elevator,
he sees Agent Smith, Agent Brown and Agent Jones leading a
group of cops.  A female employee turns and points out
Neo's cubicle.

Neo ducks.

       Holy shit!

                 NEO

       Yes.

                 MORPHEUS (V.O.)

                 MORPHEUS (V.O.)
       I can guide you out, but you have

The agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle.

                 MORPHEUS (V.O.)
       The cubicle across from you is
       empty.

       Go!  Now!

                 MORPHEUS (V.O.)

Neo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle
just as the Agents turn into his row.

Neo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone
tightly to him.

                 MORPHEUS (V.O.)
       Stay here for a moment.

The Agents enter Neo's empty cubicle.  A cop is sent to
search the bathroom.

Morpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear.

                 MORPHEUS (V.O.)
       A little longer...

Brown is talking to another employee.

The room is empty.

                 MORPHEUS (V.O.)
       Good.  Outside there is a scaffold.

                 NEO
       How do you know all this?

Morpheus laughs quietly.

                 MORPHEUS (V.O.)
       The answer is coming, Neo.  There
       is a window in front of you.  Open
       it.

He opens the window.  The WIND HOWLS into the room.

                 MORPHEUS (V.O.)
       You can use the scaffold to get to
       the roof.

                 NEO
       No!  It's too far away.

                 MORPHEUS (V.O.)
       There's a ledge.  It's a short
       short climb.  You can make it.

Neo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a
concrete chasm.

                 NEO
       No way, no way, this is crazy.

                 MORPHEUS (V.O.)
       There are only two ways out of
       this building.  One is that
       scaffold.  The other is in their
       custody.  You take a chance either

He climbs up onto the window ledge.  Hanging onto the
frame, he steps onto the small ledge.  The scaffold seems
even farther away.

                 NEO
       I'm going to die.

The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building,
knocking Neo off balance.  Recoiling, he clings harder to
the frame, and the phone falls out of his hand.

He watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath
him.

                 NEO
       This is insane!  I can't do this!

He climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the
door.

At the same moment, the door opens and the Agents enter.
Agent Smith sits down across from Neo.  A thick manila

       As you can see, we've had our eye

       Anderson.

He opens the file.  Paper rattle marks the silence as he
flips several pages.  Neo cannot tell if he is looking at
the file or at him.

                 AGENT SMITH
       It seems that you have been living
       two lives.  In one life, you are
       Thomas A. Anderson, program writer
       for a respectable software
       company.  You have a social
       security number, you pay your
       taxes and you help your landlady
       carry out her garbage.

The pages continue to turn.

                 AGENT SMITH
       The other life is lived in
       computers where you go by the
       hacker alias Neo, and are guilty
       of virtually every computer crime
       we have a law for.

Neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.

                 AGENT SMITH
       One of these lives has a future.
       One of them does not.

He closes the file.

                 AGENT SMITH
       I'm going to be as forthcoming as
       I can be, Mr. Anderson.  You are
       here because we need your help.

He removes his sunglasses, his eyes are an unnatural ice-
blue.

                 AGENT SMITH
       We know that you have been
       contacted by a certain individual.
       A man who calls himself Morpheus.
       Whatever you think you know about
       this man is irrelevant.  The fact

       My colleagues believe that I am

       believe you want to do the right
       thing.  It is obvious that you are
       an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson,
       and that you are interested in the
       future.  That is why I believe you
       are ready to put your past
       mistakes behind you and get on
       with your life.

Neo tries to match his stare.

       We are willing to wipe the slate
       clean, to give you a fresh start
       and all we are asking in return is
       your cooperation in bringing a
       known terrorist to justice.

       real good deal.  But I think I
       have a better one.  How about I

The question unnerves Neo and strangely he begins to feel
the muscles in his jaw tighten.  The standing Agents
snicker, watching Neo's confusion grow into panic.

Neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly
seal shut, melding into each other until all traces of
his mouth are gone.

Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the Agents
restrain him, holding him in the chair.

                 AGENT SMITH
       You are going to help us, Mr.
       Anderson, whether you want to or
       not.

Smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt.  From a
case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a long,
fiber-optic wire tap.

Neo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over
his exposed abdomen.  Horrified, he watches as the
electronic device animates, becoming an organic creature
that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.

Thin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into
Neo's navel.  He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature
which looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --

-- before it begins to burrow, its tail thrashing as it
worms its way inside.

Screaming, Neo bolts upright in bed.

He realizes that he is home.  Was it a dream?  His mouth
is normal.  His stomach looks fine.  He starts to take a
deep, everything-is-okay breath when --

The PHONE RINGS.

It almost stops his heart.  It continues RINGING,
building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed,
sucking him in with an almost gravitational force.  He
answers it, saying nothing.

       No I'm not.  Clear.

The foreboding word hangs in Neo's ear for a moment when
Trinity squeezes a trigger.  Electric current hammers
into Neo and rigid convulsions take hold of him beneath
the flickering car lamp until --

Something finally rockets wetly out of Neo's stomach
through the extractor's coils.

                 NEO
       Jesus Christ!  It's real?!
       That thing is real?!

Trinity lifts a glass cage at the end of the tubing.
Inside, the small fluke-like bug flips and squirms, its
tendrils flapping against the clear walls.

She unrolls the window and dumps it out.

EXT. CAR

It hits the pavement with a metallic tink, reverted back
into a common wire tap, as the car disappears into the

       Be honest.  He knows more than you
       can possibly imagine.

INT. ROOM 1313

Across the room, a DARK FIGURE stares out the tall
windows veiled with decaying lace.  He turns and his
smile lights up the room.  A dull ROAR of THUNDER shakes
the old building.

       At last.

                 MORPHEUS

He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible
behind circular mirrored glasses.  He strides to Neo and
they shake hands.

                 MORPHEUS
       Welcome, Neo.  As you no doubt
       have guessed, I am Morpheus.

       It's an honor.

                 NEO

                 MORPHEUS
       No, the honor is mine.  Please.
       Come.  Sit.

He nods to Trinity and she exits through a door to an
adjacent room.  They sit across from one another in
cracked, burgundy-leather chairs.

                 MORPHEUS
       I imagine, right now, you must be
       feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling
       down the rabbit hole?

                 NEO
       You could say that.

                 MORPHEUS
       I can see it in your eyes.  You
       have the look of a man who accepts
       what he sees because he is
       expecting to wake up.

A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.

                 MORPHEUS
       Ironically, this is not far from
       the truth.  But I'm getting ahead
       of myself.  Can you tell me, Neo,
       why are you here?

                 NEO
       You're Morpheus.  You're a legend.
       Most hackers would die to meet
       you.

                 MORPHEUS
       Yes.  Thank you.  But I think we
       both know there's more to it than
       that.  Do you believe in fate,
       Neo?

       No.

       Why not?

                 NEO

                 MORPHEUS

                 NEO
       Because I don't like the idea that
       I'm not in control of my life.

                 MORPHEUS
       I know exactly what you mean.

Again, that smile that could cut glass.

                 MORPHEUS
       Let me tell you why you are here.
       You have come because you know
       something.  What you know you
       can't explain but you feel it.
       You've felt it your whole life,
       felt that something is wrong with
       the world.  You don't know what,
       but it's there like a splinter in
       your mind, driving you mad.  It is
       this feeling that brought you to
       me.  Do you know what I'm talking
       about?

       The Matrix?

                 NEO

                 MORPHEUS
       Do you want to know what it is?

Neo swallows hard and nods.

                 MORPHEUS
       The Matrix is everywhere, it's all
       around us, here even in this room.
       You can see it out your window or
       on your television.  You feel it
       when you go to work, or go to
       church or pay your taxes.  It is
       the world that has been pulled
       over your eyes to blind you from
       the truth.

       What truth?

                 NEO

                 MORPHEUS
       That you are a slave, Neo.  Like
       everyone else, you were born into
       bondage, kept inside a prison that
       you cannot smell, taste, or touch.
       A prison for your mind.

The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.

                 MORPHEUS
       Unfortunately, no one can be told
       what the Matrix is.  You have to
       see it for yourself.

Morpheus opens his hands.  In the right is a red pill.
In the left, a blue pill.

                 MORPHEUS
       This is your last chance.  After
       this, there is no going back.  You
       take the blue pill and the story
       ends.  You wake in your bed and
       you believe whatever you want to
       believe.

The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.

                 MORPHEUS
       You take the red pill and you stay
       in Wonderland and I show you how
       deep the rabbit-hole goes.

Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, the moisture
growing in his palms.

                 MORPHEUS
       Remember that all I am offering is
       the truth.  Nothing more.

He leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with
high-tech equipment, glowing ash-blue and electric green
from the racks of monitors.  Trinity, Apoc, Switch and
Cypher look up as they enter.

                 MORPHEUS
       Apoc, are we on-line?

       Almost.

                 APOC

He and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex
system of monitors, modules and drives.

                 MORPHEUS
       Neo, time is always against us.
       Will you take a seat there?

Neo sits in a chair in the center of the room and Trinity
begins gently fixing white electrode disks to him.  Near
the chair is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked.
He whispers to Trinity:

                 NEO
       You did all this?

She nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears.
They are wired to an old hotel phone.

                 MORPHEUS
       The pill you took is part of a
       trace program.  It's designed to
       disrupt your input/output carrier
       signal so we can pinpoint your
       location.

                 NEO
       What does that mean?

                 CYPHER
       It means buckle up, Dorothy,
       'cause Kansas is going bye-bye.

Distantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING
on a KEYBOARD.  Sweat beads his face.  His eyes blink and
twitch when he notices the mirror.

Wide-eyed, he stares as it begins to heal itself, a
webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the
mirror were becoming liquid.

       Did you...?

                 NEO

Cypher works with Apoc, checking reams of phosphorescent
data.  Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs.  Neo
reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers disappear
beneath the rippling surface.

Quickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror
stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored taffy
stuck to his fingertips.

                 MORPHEUS
       Have you ever had a dream, Neo,
       that you were so sure was real?

A flash of lightning flickers white hot against Neo.

                 NEO
       This can't be...

                 MORPHEUS
       Be what?  Be real?

The strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away,
until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break.

                 MORPHEUS
       What if you were unable to wake
       from that dream, Neo?  How would
       you know the difference between
       the dreamworld and the real world?

Neo looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored
icicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running
like wax down his fingers, spreading across his palm
where he sees his face reflected.

       Uh-oh...

                 NEO

Morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number.

       Tank, we're going to need the
       signal soon.

The mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up
his arms like hundreds of insects.

The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic,
tipping his head as though he were sinking into the
mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.

       It's cold.

                 NEO

Streams of mercury run from Neo's nose.

An ALARM on Trinity's monitor ERUPTS.

His eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a
HIGH-PITCHED ELECTRIC SCREAM erupts in the HEADPHONES.
It is a piercing shriek like a computer calling to
another computer --

Neo's body arches in agony and we are PULLED like we were
pulled INTO the holes of the phone, sucked into his scream
and swallowed by darkness.

His body spasms, fighting against the thick gelatin.

Metal tubes, surreal versions of hospital tubes, obscure
his face.  Other lines like IVs are connected to limbs
and cover his genitals.

He is struggling desperately now.  Air bubbles into the
Jell-O but does not break the surface.  Pressing up, the
surface distends, stretching like a red rubber cocoon.

Unable to breathe, he fights wildly to stand, clawing at
the thinning elastic shroud, until it ruptures, a hole
widening around his mouth as he sucks for air.  Tearing
himself free, he emerges from the cell.

It is Neo.

He is bald and naked, his body slick with gelatin.
Dizzy, nauseous, he waits for his vision to focus.

He is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled
with magenta gelatin, the surface of which has solidified
like curdled milk.  The IVs in his arms are plugged into
outlets that appear to be grafted to his flesh.

He feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the
back of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial
plugged and locked into the base of his skull.  He tries
to pull it out but it would be easier to pull off a
finger.

To either side he sees other tube-shaped pods filled with
magenta gelatin; beneath the wax-like surface, pale and
motionless, he sees other human beings.

Fanning out in a circle, there are more.  All connected
to a center core, each capsule like a red, dimly-glowing
petal attached to a black metal stem.

Above him, level after level, the stem rises seemingly
forever.  He moves to the foot of the capsule and looks
out.  The image assaults his mind.

Towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible
heights, disappearing down into a dim murk like an
underwater abyss.

His sight is blurred and warped, exaggerating the
intensity of the vision.  The sound of the plant is like
the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of
Leviathan.

From above, a machine drops directly in front of Neo.  He
swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him.  It is
almost insect-like in its design; beautiful housings of
alloyed metal covering organic-like systems of hard and
soft polymers.

The machine seizes hold of Neo, paralyzing him as the
cable lock at the back of his neck spins and opens.

The cable disengages itself.  A long, clear plastic
needle and cerebrum-chip slides from the anterior of
Neo's skull with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid.  The
other connective hoses snap free and snake away as the
machine lets Neo go.

Suddenly, the back of the unit opens and a tremendous
vacuum, like an airplane door opening, sucks the gelatin
and then Neo into a black hole.

Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the

The metallic cable then lifts, pulling him up into the

The metal harness opens and drops the half-conscious Neo

He runs his hand over the short hair now covering his
head.  His fingers find and explore the large outlet in
the base of his skull.

Just as he starts to come unglued, Morpheus opens the
door.

       And this, this is the Core.  This
       is where we broadcast our pirate
       signal and hack into the Matrix.

It is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment.  Vines of
coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic
battery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks
of life systems and computer monitors.

At the center of the web, there are six ecto-skeleton
chairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness.
Near the circle of chairs is the control console and
operator's station where the network is monitored.

He feels Morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack at

       Right now, we're inside a computer
       program?

Morpheus smiles.

                 MORPHEUS
       Is it so hard to believe?  Your
       clothes are different, the plugs
       in your arms and head are gone.
       Look at your hair, you were bald a
       moment ago.

Neo touches his head.

       It's what we call residual self
       image.  The mental projection of
       your electronic self.  Wild, isn't
       it?

Neo's hands run over the cracked leather.

                 NEO
       This -- This isn't real?

                 MORPHEUS
       What is real?  How do you define
       real?  If you're talking about
       what you feel, taste, smell, or
       see, then real is simply
       electrical signals interpreted by
       your brain.

He picks up a remote control and clicks on the
television.  On the television, we see images of the
Twentieth Century city where Neo lived.

                 MORPHEUS
       This is the world you know.  The
       world as it was at the end of the
       Twentieth Century.  It exists now
       only as part of a neural-
       interactive simulation that we
       call the Matrix.

He changes the channel and we see a very different city
as we enter the television.

                 MORPHEUS
       You have been living inside a
       dreamworld, Neo.  As in
       Baudrillard's vision, your whole
       life has been spent inside the
       map, not the territory.  This is
       the world as it exists today.

In the distance, we see the ruins of a future city
protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of
a long-dead corpse.

                 MORPHEUS
       'The desert of the real.'

Beneath us, the water is gone.

We TURN AND DESCEND, SPIRALING DOWN TOWARD the lake bed
which is scorched and split like burnt flesh, where we
FIND Morpheus and Neo.  Neo clings to the chair, trying
to get his bearings.

                 MORPHEUS
       We have only bits and pieces of
       information.  What we know for
       certain is that, at some point in
       the early Twenty-first Century,
       all of mankind was united in
       celebration.  Through the blinding
       inebriation of hubris, we marveled
       at our magnificence as we gave
       birth to A.I.

                 NEO
       A.I.?  You mean artificial
       intelligence?

                 MORPHEUS
       Yes.  A singular consciousness
       that spawned an entire race of
       machines.  I must say I find it
       almost funny to imagine the world
       slapping itself on the back,
       toasting the new age.  I say
       almost funny.

He looks up and his sunglasses reflect the obsidian
clouds roiling overhead.

                 MORPHEUS
       We don't know who struck first.
       Us or them.  But we do know it was
       us that scorched the sky.  At the
       time, they were dependent on solar
       power.  It was believed they would
       be unable to survive without an
       energy source as abundant as the
       sun.

As we DESCEND INTO the circular window of his glasses,
there is a flash of lightning.

                 MORPHEUS
       Throughout human history, we have
       been dependent on machines to
       survive.  Fate, it seems, is not
       without a sense of irony.

40

EXT. FETUS FIELDS

On the flash, we PULL BACK from the darkness which
reveals itself to be the black eye of a fetus.

                                      41.

40

                 MORPHEUS
       The Machines discovered a new form
       of fusion.  All they needed was a
       small electrical charge to
       initiate the reaction.

The fetus is suspended in a placenta-like husk, where its
malleable skull is already growing around the brain-jack.

                 MORPHEUS
       The human body generates more
       bioelectricity than a 120-volt
       battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s
       of body heat.

The husk hanging from a stalk is plucked by a thresher-
like farm machine.

                 MORPHEUS
       There are fields, endless fields
       where human beings are no longer
       born; we are grown.

We RISE UP, the field stretching in every direction to
the horizon, lightning tearing open the sky as a
harvester sweeps past us.

INT. POWER PLANT

From the yawning black of the waste port, we begin to
PULL BACK as it snaps shut.

Red amniotic gel flows into the pod below us, pooling
around a tiny newborn that suckles its feed tube.

                 MORPHEUS
       For the longest time, I wouldn't
       believe it.  But then I saw the
       fields with my own eyes, watched
       them liquefy the dead so they
       could be fed intravenously to the
       living and standing there, facing
       the efficiency, the pure,
       horrifying precision, I came to
       realize the obviousness of the
       truth.

Still PULLING BACK, we see the image of the power plant
now on the television as we return to the white space of
the construct.

Morpheus steps INTO VIEW as he clicks off the television.

                 MORPHEUS
       What is the Matrix?  Control.

He opens the back of the television remote control.

                 MORPHEUS
       The Matrix is a computer-generated
       dreamworld built to keep us under
       control in order to change a human
       being into this.

He holds up a coppertop battery.

                 NEO
       No!  I don't believe it!  It's not
       possible!

                 MORPHEUS
       I didn't say that it would be
       easy, Neo.  I just said that it
       would be the truth.

                 TRINITY
       Easy, Neo.  Easy.

Dozer holds him while Trinity unlocks it.  Once it's out,
he tears away from them, falling as he trips free of the
harness.

                 NEO
       Don't touch me!  Get away from me!

On his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins.
Sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull
as if his brain had been put into a centrifuge.

                 NEO

He blinks, regaining consciousness.  The room is dark.
Neo is stretched out on his bed.

                 NEO
       I can't go back, can I?

Morpheus is sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far
corner.

                 MORPHEUS
       No.  But if you could, would you
       really want to?

Deep down, Neo knows that answer.

                 MORPHEUS
       I feel that I owe you an apology.
       There is a rule that we do not
       free a mind once it reaches a
       certain age.  It is dangerous.
       They have trouble letting go.
       Their mind turns against them.
       I've seen it happen.  I'm sorry.
       I broke the rule because I had to.

He stares into the darkness, confessing as much to
himself as to Neo.

                 MORPHEUS
       When the Matrix was first built
       there was a man born inside that
       had the ability to change what he
       wanted, to remake the Matrix as he
       saw fit.  It was this man that
       freed the first of us and taught
       us the truth; as long as the
       Matrix exists, the human race will
       never be free.

He pauses.

                 MORPHEUS
       When he died, the Oracle
       prophesied his return and
       envisioned that his coming would
       hail the destruction of the
       Matrix, an end to the war and
       freedom for our people.  That is
       why there are those of us that
       have spent our entire lives
       searching the Matrix, looking for
       him.

Neo can feel his eyes on him.

                 MORPHEUS
       I did what I did because I believe
       the search is over.

He stands up.

                 MORPHEUS
       Get some rest.  You're going to
       need it.

       For what?

       might even see it.

       Goddamn, I got to tell you, I'm

       Why don't we start with something
       a little fun?

Tank smiles as he plops into his operator's chair.  He
begins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro
discs.

                 TANK
       How about some combat training?

Neo reads the label on the disk.

                 NEO
       Jujitsu?  I'm going to learn
       jujitsu?

Tank slides the disk into Neo's supplement drive.

       No way.

Smiling, Tank punches the "load" code.  His body jumps
against the harness as his eyes clamp shut.  The monitors
kick wildly as his heart pounds, adrenaline surges, and
his brain sizzles.  An instant later his eyes snap open.

They are standing in a very sparse Japanese-style dojo.

                 MORPHEUS
       This is a sparring program,
       similar to the programmed reality
       of the Matrix.  It has the same
       basic rules.  Rules like gravity.
       What you must learn is that these
       rules are no different than the
       rules of a computer system.  Some
       of them can be bent.  Others can
       be broken.  Understand?

Neo nods as Morpheus assumes a fighting stance.

                 MORPHEUS
       Then hit me, if you can.

Neo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until
he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack.

It is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and
feet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack,
but each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed.

Morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen.
His feet and fists are everywhere, taking Neo apart.  For
every blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --

Neo falls.

Panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits from his
mouth, speckling the white floor of the dojo.

       stronger has anything to do with
       my muscles in this place?

Neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath.

rage as the speed of the blows rises like a drum solo.

His eyes widen as he plummets.  Stories fly by, the

way, stretching like a trapeze net.  He bounces and flips,
slowly coming to a rest, flat on his back.

He laughs, a bit unsure, wiping the windblown tears from
his face.  Morpheus exits the building and helps him to
his feet.

                 MORPHEUS
       Do you know why you didn't make
       it?

                 NEO

But Trinity has already left.

Neo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out.  He tries to
move and groans, cradling his ribs.  While Tank helps
Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand.

She turns and he watches her walk away.

EXT. CITY STREET - TRAINING PROGRAM - DAY

Morpheus moves effortlessly through a crowded downtown
street while Neo struggles to keep up, constantly bumped
and shouldered off the path.

                 MORPHEUS
       The Matrix is a system, Neo, and
       that system is our enemy.  But
       when you are inside and you look
       around, what do you see;
       businessmen, lawyers, teachers,
       carpenters.  The minds of the very
       people we are trying to save.  But
       until we do, these people are
       still a part of the system and
       that makes them our enemy.

A cop writing a parking ticket stares at Neo from behind
his sunglasses.

                 MORPHEUS
       You have to understand that most
       of these people are not ready to
       be unplugged and many of them are
       so inured, so hopelessly dependent
       on the system that they will fight
       to protect it.

A beautiful woman in a red dress smiles at Neo as she
passes by.

                 MORPHEUS
       Were you listening to me, Neo?  Or
       were you looking at the woman in
       the red dress?

Neo screams.

       Freeze it.

                 MORPHEUS

Everything except Morpheus and Neo freezes.

                 NEO
       This -- this isn't the Matrix?

                 MORPHEUS
       No, it's another training program
       designed to teach you one thing;
       if you are not one of us, you're
       one of them.

       What are they?

                 NEO

                 MORPHEUS
       Sentient programs.  They can move
       in and out of any software still
       hardwired to their system.  That
       means that anyone that we haven't
       unplugged is potentially an Agent.
       Inside the Matrix, they are
       everyone and they are no one.

Neo stares at the Agent.

                 MORPHEUS
       We've survived by hiding from
       them, running from them, but they
       are the gatekeepers, they're
       guarding all the doors, holding
       all the keys, which means that
       sooner or later someone is going
       to have to fight them.

       Someone?

                 NEO

                 MORPHEUS
       I won't lie to you, Neo.  Every
       single man or woman who has stood
       their ground, who has fought an
       Agent, has died.  But where they
       failed, you will succeed.

       Why?

                 MORPHEUS
       I've seen an Agent punch through a
       concrete wall.  Men have emptied
       entire clips at them and hit
       nothing but air.  Yet their
       strength and their speed are still
       based on a world that is built by
       rules.  Because of that they will
       never be as strong or as fast as
       you can be.

Neo scratches his head.

                 NEO
       What?  Are you trying to tell me
       that I can dodge bullets?

                 MORPHEUS
       No, Neo.  I'm trying to tell you
       that when you're ready, you won't
       have to.

Morpheus' cell PHONE RINGS and he flips it open.

Morpheus scans the decayed landscape of the sewer main
that rolls by as Neo and Trinity squeeze into the cockpit
behind him.  An ALARM BEGINS TO SOUND.

       weapon we have against the
       machines.

Dozer looks up.

       Now we wait.

                 DOZER

THROUGH the cockpit's windshield, the vast cavern of the
sewer main yawns before them.  Strands of green haze curl
round mossy icicles that dangle into a pool of churning
frozen waste.  Neo begins to angle around Dozer but
Morpheus grabs him.

                 MORPHEUS
       Don't move.  It'll hear you.

Neo freezes and they wait. Without the Nebuchadnezzar's
heating systems, the temperature in the cockpit begins to
rapidly drop.  The crew members huddle together, their
breath freezing into a uniform cloud as it gets colder
and colder.

Dozer quietly reaches to brush away the frost on the
windshield and as his hand clears a swath --

They see it.

In the darkness, a shifting shadow of mechanized death.
It is beautiful and terrifying.  Black alloy skin
flickers like sequins beneath sinewy coils and skeletal
appendages.

Neo can feel the hairs on the back of his neck rise as it
silently glides over them with shark-like malevolence
until it disappears into the darkness.

In the frozen little room, everyone breathes a little
easier.

Neo stares at the endlessly shifting river of
information, bizarre codes and equations flowing across
the face of the monitor.

                 NEO
       Do you always look at it encoded?

                 CYPHER
       Have to.  The image translators
       sort of work for the construct
       programs but there's way too much
       information to decode the Matrix.
       You get used to it, though.  Your
       brain does the translating.  I

       thing that makes us human.

Morpheus enters.

                 MORPHEUS
       I want everyone on twelve-hour
       standby.  We're going in.  I'm
       taking Neo to see her.

With that he turns and leaves.

without sunglasses.

Apoc and Switch remain at the door as the others enter
the alley.

                 MORPHEUS
       We should be back in an hour.

Cypher opens the driver's door of an old car as Trinity,
Morpheus and Neo cross to the car, Cypher glances about
quickly, then drops something inside a garbage can.

He is speaking in a whisper, almost as if talking to
himself.

                 NEO
       I have these memories, from my
       entire life but... none of them
       really happened.

He turns to her.

                 NEO
       What does that mean?

                 TRINITY
       That the Matrix cannot tell you
       who you are.

                 NEO
       But an Oracle can.

                 TRINITY
       That's different.

       Obviously.

He turns to the window for a moment and then turns back.

INT. HALL

The long dark hall beckons.  Neo follows Morpheus out of
the elevator and the DOORS RATTLE shut behind him.  With
every step, a disturbing sense of inevitability closes in
around him.

At the end of the hall, Morpheus steps to the side of a
door.

                 MORPHEUS
       I told you that I can only show
       you the door.  You have to step
       through it.

Neo blows out a breath.  His hand reaches but stops,
hovering over the spherical handle.  He backs away.

                 NEO
       Morpheus, I don't think this is a
       good idea.

       Why?

                 MORPHEUS

                 NEO
       I told you I don't believe in this

                 NEO
       What do I believe in?  Are you
       kidding me?  What do you think?
       The world I grew up in isn't real.
       My entire life was a lie.  I don't
       believe in anything anymore.

                 MORPHEUS
 
       That's why we're here.

                 NEO
       Why?  So I can hear some old lady
       tell me, what?  That I'm this guy
       that everybody's been waiting for?
       That I'm supposed to save the
       world?  It sounds insane.
       Unbelievable.  And I don't care
       who says it, it's still going to
       sound insane and unbelievable.

                 MORPHEUS
       Faith is not a matter of
       reasonability.  I do not believe
       things with my mind.  I believe
       them with my heart.  In my gut.

                 NEO
       And you believe I'm the One?

       Yes I do.

                 MORPHEUS

                 NEO
       Yeah?  What about the other five
       guys?  The five before me?  What
       about them?

Morpheus tries to hide his heart being wrenched from his
chest.

                 NEO
       Did you believe in them too?

                 MORPHEUS
       I believed what the Oracle told
       me... no, I misunderstood what she
       told me.  I believed that it was
       all about me.

This is difficult for Morpheus to admit.

       I believed that all I had to do
       was point my finger and anoint
       whoever I chose.  I was wrong,
       Neo.  Terribly wrong.  Not a day
       or night passes that I do not
       think of them.  After the fifth, I
       lost my way.  I doubted everything
       the Oracle had said.  I doubted
       myself.

He looks up at Neo.

                 MORPHEUS
       And then I saw you, Neo, and my
       world changed.  You can call it
       an epiphany, you can call it
       whatever the hell you want.
       It doesn't matter.  It's not
       about a word.  It's about this.
       So I can't explain it to you.
       All I can do is believe, Neo,
       believe that one day you will
       feel what I felt and know what
       I know; you are the sixth and
       the last.  You are the One.

His eyes blaze.

                 MORPHEUS
       Until that time all I am asking
       from you is for you to hold on to
       whatever respect you may have for
       me and trust me.

Neo feels a rush from Morpheus's intensity, the
unadulterated confidence of a zealot.

       All right.

                 NEO

He reaches for the handle which turns without him even
touching it.  A WOMAN wearing white opens the door.

She leads Neo down another hall and into what appears to
be a family room.

There is another woman in white sitting on a couch
watching a soap opera.  Scattered about the room are a
half dozen children.  Some of them are playing, others are
deep in meditation.  All of them exude a kind of Zen calm.

                 PRIESTESS
       These are the other Potentials.
       You can wait here.

Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet
blocks.  Closer to him, a SKINNY BOY with a shaved head
holds a spoon which sways like a blade of grass.

In front of him is a pile of spoons bent and twisted into
knots.  Neo crosses to him and sits.  The boy smiles and
hands Neo the spoon which is now perfectly straight.

                 SPOON BOY (SKINNY BOY)
       Do not try to bend the spoon.
       That is impossible.  Instead, only
       try to realize the truth.

       What truth?

                 NEO

                 SPOON BOY
       That there is no spoon.

Neo nods, staring at the spoon.

                 NEO
       There is no spoon.

                 SPOON BOY
       Then you will see that it is not
       the spoon that bends.  It is only
       yourself.

The entire room is reflected inside the spoon and as Neo
stares into it, it slowly begins to bend until --

A hand touches his shoulder.

                 PRIESTESS
       The Oracle will see you now.

Spoon Boy smiles.

       You know what that means?  It's

Soldier's blinding lights cut open the darkness as
Trinity, Neo and the others crash through the ceiling.
Around them they hear a chorus of short, sharp coughs of
grenade launchers from gas-masked figures.

Smoke blossoms from the green metal canisters.  Trinity
never stops moving.  Searching the floor, she finds what
she needs; the cover of the catch basin.

Cypher watches her pry open the grate, when a gas can
bounces near him.

Morpheus, drives a vicious head butt into Agent Smith's
face.  His nose and glasses shatter.

Agent Smith, unfazed, smiles, blood oozing from the
shattered bridge of his nose, and returns Morpheus's head
butt with three of his own in pneumatic succession.

Morpheus staggers back, his body going slack when another
kick buries him deep into crunching plaster and lathe.

Morpheus turns in time to see a wall of men in the
doorway.

                 CYPHER
       I'm tired, Trinity.  I'm tired of
       this war, I'm tired of fighting.
       I'm tired of this ship, of being
       cold, of eating the same goddamn
       goop every day.  But most of all,
       I'm tired of this jagoff and all
       of his bullshit.

Cypher leans over, talking to Morpheus.

                 CYPHER
       Surprise, asshole.  But you never
       saw this coming, did you?  God, I
       wish I could be there when they
       break you.  I wish I could walk
       in just as it happens, so right
       then, you'd know it was me.

                 TRINITY
       My God.  Morpheus.  You gave them
       Morpheus.

                 CYPHER
       He lied to us, Trinity!  He
       tricked us!  If he would've told
       us the truth, we would've told
       him to shove that red pill up
       his ass!

                 TRINITY
       That's not true, Cypher.  He set
       us free.

                 CYPHER
       Free?  You call this free?  All I
       do is what he tells me to do.  If
       I have to choose between that and
       the Matrix, I choose the Matrix.

                 TRINITY
       The Matrix isn't real!

                 CYPHER
       Oh, I disagree, Trinity.  I
       disagree.  I think the Matrix can
       be more real than this world.  I
       mean, all I do is pull a plug
       here.  But there, you have to
       watch a man die.

She looks up at Apoc, her face going white.

He grabs hold of the cable in Apoc's neck, twists it and
yanks it out.

                 CYPHER
       Welcome to the real world, eh
       baby?

Apoc seems to go blind for an instant, a scream caught in
his throat, his hands reaching for nothing, and then
falls dead.

       No!

                 TRINITY
       But you're out, Cypher.  You can't
       go back.

                 CYPHER
       That's what you think.  They've
       promised to take me back.  They're
       going to reinsert my body.  I'll
       go back to sleep and when I wake
       up, I'll be fat and rich and I
       won't remember a goddamned thing.
       It's the American dream.

He laughs, his hand sliding around the neck of Switch as
he takes hold of her plug.

                 CYPHER
       By the way, if you have anything
       terribly important to say to
       Switch, I suggest you say it now.

                 TRINITY
       Oh no, please don't.

Trinity eyes find Switch and she knows she's next.

                 SWITCH
       Not like this.  Not like this.

She suddenly feels her body severed from her mind as
she is murdered.

       Don't hate me, Trinity.  I'm just
       the messenger.  And right now I'm
       going to prove it to you.

He stands over Neo.

                 CYPHER
       If Morpheus was right, then
       there's no way I can pull this
       plug, is there?

She turns to Neo, eyes wide with fear and he knows he is
next.

                 CYPHER
       If Neo is the One, then in the
       next few seconds there has to be
       some kind of miracle to stop me.
       Right?  How can he be the One if
       he's dead?

He takes hold of the cord.

                 CYPHER
       You never did answer me, Trinity,
       when I asked you before.  Did you
       buy Morpheus's bullshit?  Come on.
       You can tell me, did you?  All I
       want is a little yes or no.  Look
       into his eyes, Trinity, those big
       pretty eyes and tell me the truth.
       Yes or no.

Trinity stares at Neo as a single word falls soundlessly
from her lips.

       ... yes.

       No!

                 AGENT SMITH
       Have you ever stood and stared at
       it, Morpheus?  Marveled at its
       beauty.  Its genius.  Billions of
       people just living out their
       lives... oblivious.

Morpheus is handcuffed to a chair, stripped to the waist.
He is alternately shivering and sweating, wired to
various monitors with white disk electrodes.  Beside him,
Agent Brown sucks a serum from a glass vial, filling a
hypodermic needle.

                 AGENT SMITH
       Did you know that the first Matrix
       was designed to be a perfect human
       world?  Where none suffered, where
       everyone would be happy.  It was a
       disaster.  No one would accept the
       program.  Entire crops were lost.

Agent Brown jams the needle into Morpheus's shoulder and
plunges down.

                 AGENT SMITH
       Some believed we lacked the
       programming language to describe
       your perfect world.  But I believe
       that, as a species, human beings
       define their reality through
       suffering and misery.

Agent Brown studies the screens as the life signs react
violently to the injection.

                 AGENT SMITH
       The perfect world was a dream that
       your primitive cerebrum kept
       trying to wake up from.  Which is
       why the Matrix was redesigned to
       this:  the peak of your
       civilization.

He turns from the window.

                 AGENT SMITH
       I say 'your civilization' because
       as soon as we started thinking for
       you, it really became our
       civilization, which is, of course,
       what this is all about.

Morpheus stares hard at him, trying not to show the pain
racking his mind.

Agent Smith looks at Agent Brown.

       It's like hacking a computer.  All

                 NEO

                 TANK
       Depends on the mind.  But
       eventually, it will crack and his

       them anything they want to know.

                 NEO
       What do they want?

                 TANK
       The leader of every ship is given
       the codes to Zion's mainframe
       computer.  If an Agent had those
       codes and got inside Zion's
       mainframe, they could destroy us.

He looks up at Trinity who is pacing relentlessly.

       We can't let that happen, Trinity.
       Zion is more important than me.

       Leave me with him.

Agents Brown and Jones look at each other.

They leave and Agent Smith sits beside Morpheus.

                 AGENT SMITH
       Can you hear me, Morpheus?  I'm
       going to be honest with you.

He removes his earphone, letting it dangle over his
shoulder.

                 AGENT SMITH
       I hate this place.  This zoo.
       This prison.  This reality,
       whatever you want to call it, I
       can't stand it any longer.  It's
       the smell, if there is such a
       thing.  I feel saturated by it.  I
       can taste your stink and every
       time I do, I fear that I've
       somehow been infected by it.

He wipes sweat from Morpheus' forehead, coating the tips
of his fingers, holding them to Morpheus' nose.

                 AGENT SMITH

hands.

       I must get out of here, I must get
       free.  In this mind is the key.
       My key.

Morpheus sneers through his pain.

                 AGENT SMITH
       Once Zion is destroyed, there is
       no need for me to be here.  Do you
       understand?  I need the codes.  I
       have to get inside Zion.  You have

He begins squeezing, his fingers gouging into his flesh.

Neo is carrying a duffel bag.  Trinity has a large metal

station, drawing nervous glances.

Dark glasses, game faces.

Neo calmly passes through the METAL DETECTOR which begins
to WAIL immediately.  A SECURITY GUARD moves over toward
Neo, raising his metal detection wand.

Neo slowly sets down his duffel bag and throws open his
coat, revealing an arsenal of guns, knives and grenades
slung from a climbing harness.

       Holy shit --

                 GUARD

Neo is a blur of motion.  In a split second, three guards
are dead before they hit the ground.

A fourth guard dives for cover, clutching his radio.

                 GUARD #4
       Backup!  Send in the backup!

He looks up as Trinity sets off the metal detector.  It is
the last thing he sees.

The backup arrives.  A wave of soldiers blocking the
elevators.  The concrete cavern of the lobby becomes a
white noise ROAR of GUNFIRE.

Slate walls and pillars pock, crack, and crater
under a hail storm of EXPLOSIVE-tipped BULLETS.

They are met by the quivering spit of a SUB-HAND MACHINE
GUN and the RAZORED WHISTLE of throwing knives.  Weapons
like extensions of their bodies, are used with the same
deadly precision as their feet and their fists.

Bodies slump down to the marbled floor while Neo and
Trinity hardly even break their stride.

the building and takes a deep breath.

                 NEO
       There is no spoon.

Neo whips out his GUN and presses it to the cable, lower
than they attached themselves.

BOOM!  The CABLE SNAPS.

The counter-weights plummet, yanking Trinity and Neo up
through the shaft as the elevator falls away beneath them,
distending space, filling it with the sound of WHISTLING
METAL as they sear to the top.

The roof-access tower is now engulfed in flames as Neo
and Trinity stand amongst a pile of their fallen enemies.

Across the roof, the PILOT inside the army helicopter
watches the last of their ferocious onslaught.

                 PILOT
       I repeat, we are under attack!

Suddenly his face, his whole body dissolves, consumed by
spreading locust-like swarm of static as Agent Jones
emerges.

Just as she drops the final Marine, Trinity sees what's
coming.  Neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows
what is behind him.

Screaming, he whirls, guns filling his hands with
thought-speed.

Fingers pumping, shells ejecting, dancing up and away, we
look THROUGH the sights and gun smoke AT the Agent
blurred with motion --

Until the hammers click against the empty metal.

       Trinity!

Agent Jones charges.

       ... Help.

His GUN BOOMS as we ENTER the liquid space of --

The AIR SIZZLES with wads of lead like angry flies as Neo
twists, bends, ducks just between them.

Agent Jones, still running, narrows the gap, the bullets
coming faster until Neo, bent impossibly back, one hand
on the ground as a spiraling gray ball shears open his
shoulder.

Jones standing over him, raising his gun a final time.

       Only human...

                 AGENT JONES

Suddenly Agent Jones stops.  He hears a sharp metal
click.

Immediately, he whirls around and turns straight into the
muzzle of Trinity's .45 --

       Dodge this!

Neo is in the back bay, aiming the mounted .50 machine
gun.

       No.

He FIRES SWEEPING ACROSS the sheetrocked WALL in a
perfect line.

For an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the

chalk.

And as Morpheus starts his dive for the window, a bullet
buries itself in his leg, knocking him off balance.

       He won't make it.

Morpheus lunges, out of control --

As Neo spins, every move a whip crack, snapping the other
rope-end on to a bolted bar as --

Morpheus begins to fall, when Neo hurls himself into the
wide blue empty space, flying for a moment.

An instant later they are nearly on top of each other,
rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored
reflection of the other --

Each jamming their gun tight to the other's head.

They freeze in a kind of embrace; Neo sweating, panting,
Agent Smith machine-calm.  Agent Smith smiles.

The smile falls.  Agent Smith yanks his TRIGGER.

CLICK.

Agent Smith's face warps with rage and he attacks, fists
flying at furious speed, blows and counters, Neo
retreating as --

A knife-hand opens his forearm, and a kick sends him
slamming back against a steel column.  Stunned, he ducks
just under a punch that CRUNCHES into the BEAM, STEEL
CHUNKS EXPLODING like shrapnel.

Behind him, Neo leaps into the air, delivering a neck-
snapping reverse round-house.  Agent Smith's glasses fly
off and he glares at Neo; his eyes ice blue.

                 AGENT SMITH
       I'm going to enjoy watching you
       die, Mr. Anderson.

Agent Smith attacks with unrelenting fury, fists pounding
Neo like jackhammers.

Agent Smith grabs hold of him, lifting him into the air,
hurling him against the curved wall of the train tunnel,
where he falls inches from the electrified third-rail.

The Agent is about to jump down and press his attack when
he hears something.  From deep in the tunnel, like an
animal cry; a BURST of HIGH-SPEED METAL GRINDING against
METAL.

The sound of an ONCOMING TRAIN.

Neo tries to get up.  Agent Smith jumps down onto the
tracks and drop-kicks him in the face.  The world again
begins to shake, RUMBLING as a TRAIN NEARS.

                 AGENT SMITH
       Do you hear that, Mr. Anderson?

Agent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold forcing him to look
down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a hole in
the darkness.

                 AGENT SMITH
       That is the sound of
       inevitability.

Neo sees it coming and he starts to fight.

                 AGENT SMITH
       It is the sound of your death.

There is another METAL SCREECH, much LOUDER, CLOSER, as
Agent Smith tightens his hold.  Neo is unable to breathe.

                 AGENT SMITH
       Good-bye, Mr. Anderson.

The TRAIN ROARS at them, swallowing Agent's Smith's
words.  The veins bulge in Neo's head, as he grits
through the pain.

He is not ready to die.

                 NEO
       My name is Neo.

Impossibly, he hurls himself straight up, smashing Smith
against the concrete ceiling of the tunnel.

They fall as the sound and fury of the TRAIN EXPLODES
into the station.  Neo backflips up off the tracks just
as!--

The train barrels over Agent Smith.

Neo stands, knees shaking, when the TRAIN SLAMS on its
emergency brake.  With an ear-splitting SHRIEK of
tortured RAILS, the train slows, part of it still in the
station.

Neo turns, limping, starting to run, racing for the
escalator!--

As the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last
car open; Agent Smith bursts out in furious pursuit, his
glasses again intact.

fear.

Agent Smith gets up, bracing himself as Neo charges him
and springs into a dive.  But the impact doesn't come.
Neo sinks into Agent Smith, disappearing, his tie and coat
rippling as if he were a deep pool of water.

Spinning around he looks to the others and feels
something, like a tremor before a quake, something deep,
something that is going to change everything.

Suddenly a SEARING SOUND stabs through his earpiece as
his chest begins to swell, then balloon as!--

Neo BURSTS up out of him.  And with a final death scream,
Agent Smith EXPLODES like an empty husk in a brilliant
cacophony of light, his shards spinning away, absorbed by

       of hope.  Of peace.

in the mouthpiece of a phone.  Seen from inside.
