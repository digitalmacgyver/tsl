FADE IN:

A cave painting of the Dreamworks logo.  Push past the 
moon to the sun.  Bright.  Beautiful.  The sun DISSOLVES 
TO:

Cave paintings of a family of cavemen -- we will come to 
know them as The Croods.

                EEP  
       With every sun comes a new day.  A new 
       beginning.  A hope that things will be 
       better today than they were yesterday.

The Croods scurry out of their cave like mice looking for 
food. Scared. Fast. 

The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They 
escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.

                EEP 
       But not for me.  My names Eep.  This, is 
       my family, the Croods.  If you werent 
       clued in already by the animal skins and 
       sloping foreheads - were cavemen.  Most 
       days we spend in our cave, in the dark.  
       Night after night, day after day.  Yep.  
       Home sweet home.  When we did go out, we 
       struggled to find food in a harsh and 
       hostile world.  And I struggled to 
       survive my family.

The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They 
escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks.

                EEP 
       We were the last ones around.  There used 
       to be neighbors.  The Gorts, smashed by a 
       mammoth.  The Horks, swallowed by a sand 
       snake.  The Erfs, mosquito bite.  Throgs, 
       common cold.  And, the Croods.  Thats 
       us.  The Croods made it...

Grug protects his family from a GIANT BEAR OWL.

                EEP 
       Because of my Dad.  He was strong... and 
       he followed the rules.

A shadow falls across their feet and Grug ushers his 
family home.


                EEP 
       ... the ones painted on the cave walls.  
       Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad, 
       going out at night is bad.  Basically, 
       anything fun is bad.  Welcome to my 
       world.   

They all run back into the cave where Grug slams the rock 
door closed.

SLOWLY LIGHT ON CAVE PAINTINGS COMES UP AGAIN. But this 
time the light casts an ominous tone.  

                EEP 
       But this is a story about how all that 
       changed in an instant.  

RAPID SHOTS OF THE GREAT SPLIT CUTTING THROUGH THE LAND.  
HEADED TOWARDS CROOD VALLEY.

SHOTS OF CATACLYSM.  CUT FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL...  

                EEP 
       Because what we didnt know, was that our 
       world was about to come to an end.  And 
       there were no rules on our cave walls to 
       prepare us for that.

CAVEMAN HANDS PRESS against the rock wall.  They PUSH.  A 
BLINDING LIGHT FLOODS the screen.

CUT TO:

SEQ. 100 - MEET THE CROODS

A HUGE CAVEMAN, GRUG, RUSHES forward, screaming, 
growling, and throwing handfuls of dirt in a THREAT 
DISPLAY.  He BLINKS in the bright morning light.  He 
LIFTS and HURLS a large boulder.

                GRUG
       Raaaaar  grooooOOOOoooowwwll  ERF ERF 
       Glaaaaaabbbbllllllllthhhh!

As suddenly as he began, Grug stops.  Panting, he waits 
for the echoes of his outburst to fade.

Grug TURNS to the cave entrance, he prepares to BELLOW a 
signal, but before any sound escapes his lips--

A CAVE GIRL, EEP, bursts from the cave.  


                GRUG 
       Youre supposed to wait for my signal 
       Eep. Eep?

Eep scares a pack of nearby Liyotes away.  They pounce on 
Grug briefly before scampering off.  Eep spreads out on 
an overhanging rock.  She BASKS IN THE SUN.

                EEP
       Weve been in that cave forever.

                GRUG
       Three days is not forever.

                EEP
       It is with this family.

                GRUG
       Eep would you come down here?  Youre 
       being so dramatic. 

A LITTLE GIRL, SANDY, charges out next.  Her display is 
more terrier-like.

                GRUG 
       No, no, no Sandy, come back here.  
       Remember the signal.  Good girls wait for 
       the signal.

A CAVE WOMAN, UGGA, scrambles out next.  She is mostly 
focused on catching Sandy, giving only cursory effort to 
her display.

                GRUG 
       Ugga.


                UGGA
       As soon as I get Sandy, Ill go back in, 
       and you can give the signal.

                GRUG
       No, I mean, youre already out now.

                THUNK 
       I am waiting for the signal, dad.

We HEAR the voice of Grugs nine-year-old son from inside 
the cave.  THUNK is eager to please his dad and emulates 
his every move.

                GRUG
       Never mind, Thunk.  Just, come out.

                THUNK
            (not so fast)
       Uhh, but if you dont give the signal, 
       how do I know youre my dad?

                GRUG
       The signal isnt so you know its me, 
       its so you know I wasnt eaten by an 
       animal.

Beat.

                THUNK
       Then why is the signal an animal noise?  
       I mean, doesnt that just confuse things?

Grug sighs.

                THUNK 
       I dont know... Im still waiting for the 
       signal.

                GRUG
       Sigh. Hoo hooooo!  Hoo hooooo!

Thunk comes out growling, and barrels into Grug.  Thunk 
picks up a boulder and throws it.  It ricochets off the 
cliff wall and careens into Grug.  Grug gets plowed over 
by the boulder.

                UGGA
       Mom, were ready to leave.
            (beat)
       Mom!

Grug sits up and smiles.

                GRAN
       Still alive!


Grugs face drops.

                GRUG
       Its still early.

                GRAN
       And youre still fat.

                GRUG
       Breakfast formation!  

The Croods form up in a flying wedge, with Grug in the 
lead.



                GRUG 
       I want to see some real caveman action 
       out there.  We do this fast.  We do this 
       loud, we do this as a family and never 
       not be afraid.  Go!

                THUNK
       YAY, BREAKFAST!!!!

COMPRESSED TIME - The Croods RUN out of Crood canyon, 
across the wide expanses of desert.

CUT TO:

SEQ. 150 - SMASH & GRAB

EXT. MOUTH OF CROOD CANYON - MORNING

Grug and the Croods come to a stop at the HUNTING 
GROUNDS.  They are spent from a fifteen-mile run.

                THUNK
            (huffing)
       Yeah... breakfast...

We see a nest with a huge unguarded blue egg.  The Croods 
take shelter behind a rock.  Grug PEERS over the top.

 
                GRUG
      Whos up?

Eeps hand SHOOTS up.  Thunk is less than enthusiastic.

                GRUG 
       Well flip for it.

Grug LIFTS Gran on his hand, and FLIPS her up in the air.

                GRUG 
       Call her in the air.

                EEP
       Heads.  


Gran FACE-PLANTS, her head buried in the sand.  Only her 
tail is showing.

                GRUG
       Tails.  Thunks in.

                GRUG 
       Positions.



The family fades back and splits up.  They get into 
fighting/running position.

                GRUG 
       Ok.  Thunk.  Go.  Come on Thunk.

Thunk BREAKS COVER.  He dashes into the open, SNATCHES 
the egg.

                GRUG 
       Hah!  Way to go.  Take it to the cave!  

Thunk PASSES Grug and makes a bee-line for Crood Canyon.

A Gerf bird smashes Thunk and steals the egg back.  

  
                GRUG 
     Oooh! 

                GRUG 
       Release the baby.

Eep and Sandy MOVE IN on the bird.  Sandy NIPS at its 
heels while UGGA CLIMBS up onto its head.  She PULLS the 
egg from its beak.  

Down range, TRIP GERBILS SURFACE.  They STRETCH their 
shared tail across the Ramus path like an arresting 
cable on a carrier.

Ugga RISES to THROW the egg to Grug - the gerbils WRAP 
their tail around the Ramu like a bola.  The Ramu GOES 
DOWN hard.  Ugga and the egg ROLL forward.  The Trip 
Gerbils SNATCH up the egg and make off with it.

                UGGA
       Get um Mom!  Do it for the Croods!

Grans cane HOOKS the gerbils in the middle of their tail 
and WHIPS them up and over her shoulder.

ON GRAN 

DRIBBLING the egg down-range with her cane like a hockey 
player.  LIYOTES POP UP from behind hoodoos.  They SWARM 
in behind her.  

The Liyotes TRIP Gran.  They steal the egg, and HIT THE 
GAS.  They are INCREDIBLY FAST.

                GRAN
       Old lady down!  Eep, avenge me.

ON EEP 

Crouched in the shade of a scrubby bush, like a runner on 
the blocks - she has the Liyotes in her sights.  Eep 
LAUNCHES.

Eep runs after the Liyote with the egg, cutting him off 
in his tracks he slams into a cactus launching the egg 
into the air. Eep leaps into the air taking back the egg.

                EEP
       Thanks!


A bunch of Jackrobats see Eep and swarm around her.  She 
loses her footing and throws the egg to Grug.  

                GRUG
       Eep!


                EEP
       Heads Up!


Grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small 
cave. Thunk following close behind accidentally trips 
over the tail of a sleeping Bear Owl knocking Grug to the 
ground and fumbling the egg once again. 

Thunk catches the egg just as the Girelephant bears down 
on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks.  
The family members meet up as they begin their long run 
back to the cave.

An entire swarm of animals chase the Croods as they head 
back to their cave. 

The Bear Owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the 
chase. 

Grug protecting his family from the BearOwl tosses each 
family member onto the Girelephants back.

Grug dodges the BearOwls attack and uses him as a 
launching pad to get himself safely on the Girelephant.

Thunk is happy to see Dad is safe.

                THUNK
       Oh hey Dad, can we eat now?

                GRUG
       Just wait till we get home. Eep put on 
       the brakes.

The entrance to Crood canyon appears on the horizon.


Eep hangs off the edge of one of its tusks as Grug takes 
over the other. Together they dig their heels into the 
ground, slowing down the Girelephant.

The Bearowl continues the chase. The Croods maneuver the 
Girelephant to fend off the Bearowl.

                GRUG 
       Eep!


The Girelephant moving way too fast readies for the 
crash. The Girelephant crashes into the entrance of the 
canyon, sending the Croods flying in.  They all tumble.  
Grug makes an extraordinary football catch. He holds 
tight to the meal as he slams into a rock. Grug holds up 
the egg.

                GRUG 
       Whos hungry?  

                THUNK
       Alright! Good one, dad!

                GRUG
       Here you go, Thunk.  Drink up.

Grug tosses the egg to Thunk, Thunk fumbles it and it 
cracks open.  

                THUNK
       Sorry, dad.


                UGGA
       Looks like fast food tonight!

The family passes the leaky egg around quickly, each 
Crood gets a taste.  Thunk is the last Crood to get a 
mouthful, he hands it over to Grug-- the egg is empty.

                GRUG
       Thats alright.  I ate last week.

A SHADOW TOUCHES Grugs feet.  He looks up - the sun is 
setting behind the canyon wall.  He HOLDS UP his hand to 
gauge how much daylight is left.

                GRAN
       Two knuckle warning.

                UGGA
       Come on Croods. Go, go, go.

SEQ. 200 - WELCOME TO CROOD CAVE

INT. CROOD CAVE - EVENING

                GRUG
       Come on, come on.  Darkness brings death!  
       We know this.

The Croods RUN INSIDE THE CAVE.  Ugga picks up a heavy 
stick off the floor.

                UGGA
       The moon is full.  Bath night.  
            (grumbling, Gran tries to run 
            away)
       You too, Mom.  

                GRAN
       Run for your life.

Ugga pulls Gran back.

                GRAN 
       I dont want to lose my protective layer.

                UGGA
       Mom, youve got ants. 
            (hanging Sandy up)

Whack!  Like shes cleaning a rug, Ugga SMACKS Sandy hard 
with the stick.  Dust and bugs fly off of her.

                UGGA 
       See?  Sandy doesnt fuss.

Ugga CLAPS her hands together and Sandy knows to let go.  
She hits the floor and SCAMPERS away.

                GRAN
            (upset)
       Aaaaaaaaaah.

Grug enters and looks around the cave.

                GRUG
       Is she still out there?

                UGGA
       You know she hates the cave, Grug.

ON EEP clinging to the side of the sheer rock face above 
Crood cave.  She RAISES HER HAND to catch a few more 
moments of sun.  



                EEP
       Please come back tomorrow.

ON GRUG getting his bath.

                GRUG
       How can she not like the cave?  Its so 
       cozy.

                UGGA
       It is a little, dark, Grug.

                GRUG
       Its not that dark.

Grug is finished with his bath. 

                GRUG 
            (losing patience)
       Eep!  Eep?

Eep begins to climb down the wall outside when she hears 
a sound in the distance. Curious, she begins to climb 
even higher.  Grug leaves the cave, searching for her.

                GRUG 
       Come on, I gotta close the cave...

ON GRUG exiting the cave... Grug sees that Eep is at the 
very top. 

  
                GRUG 
     Eep!

Eep continues to climb.

 
                EEP
       Okay, okay!


                GRUG
      Come on.

Behind Grug, the Bear Owl appears up the canyon.  It 
SPOTS Grug and the open cave and RACES to attack. Grug 
sees the BearOwl in full attack mode.

                GRUG 
       EEP!  COME DOWN!!

Grug throws a rock which momentarily stuns the creature, 
allowing Eep to JUMP DOWN and DART into the cave.  Grug 
barely gets the cave closed in time.

                GRUG 
       *Sigh*

SEQ. 210 - BEDTIME STORY

The Bear Owl PUSHES his paw through the narrow opening, 
and FEELS around for the Croods.  The Croods are like 
mice in this world.

                GRUG
       That was too close!

                EEP
       I was watching.  I was fine.

                GRUG
       What were you doing up there, Eep? 

                EEP
       I dont know.

                GRUG
       What were you looking for?

                EEP
       Nothing.


                GRUG
       Well then why did you go up there?

                EEP
            (annoyed)
       I dont know.

                GRUG
       Why dont you know? Stop looking for 
       things.  Fear keeps us alive Eep.  Never 
       not be afraid.

Eep climbs up on a ledge and curls up in the corner where 
a tiny spot of light seeps in.

                EEP
            (to herself)
       Whats the point of all this?

                GRUG
       Hmmm? What was that?


                EEP
            (a little louder)
       I mean, why are we here?  What are we 
       doing this for? 

   
                CROODS
    	*Groan*

                GRUG
       No one said survival was fun.

                EEP
       Nothing is fun.

                GRUG
       Hmm?  Would you come down here.  Eep?

No answer.  Grug CLIMBS up.  Ugga PULLS Grug back down.

  
Grug climbs back up.

                UGGA
       Grug. Off. 


                GRUG
     		Yes.

                UGGA 
       Off!


                GRUG
       I just dont see why she needs her own 
       ledge.  Thats all.  Thats what this is 
       about.

                UGGA
       Shes working through some things and 
       needs her own space.

                GRUG
       What things?   How long is this going to 
       take?  Really?  I mean she already 
       doesnt listen to me.

A pebble hits Grug in the head.  It came from Eeps 
ledge.

                GRUG 
       Hey!


                UGGA
       See?  Shes listening.


                GRUG
       If she wants to survive, she has to 
       follow our rules.

                UGGA
       How about a story?  Eep loves those.

Grug brightens.

                GRUG
            (brightening)
       Thats a good idea ... How about a story, 
       huh? 

                THUNK
       Oh yeah, tell us a story.

The Croods minus Eep gather in a semi-circle on the 
ground.  Grug retrieves Sandy and her Krispy Bear from 
the bone-crib.

                GRUG
       Ok.  Can I borrow that?  Thank you.  Eep!  
       Your old favorite?

                EEP
       I havent played with that thing in 
       years.

                GRUG
       Tonight well hear the story of Krispy
       Bear.

Grug sits and waits a beat for Eep to join, but she stays 
put.

As Grug talks, he gestures at a rough sketch on the wall 
of the cave.

                GRUG 
       A long time ago, this little bear was 
       alive.  She was alive because she 
       listened to her father and lived her life 
       in routine and darkness and terror.  So 
       she was happy.  But Krispy had one, 
       terrible problem.  She was filled with... 
       curiosity.

 
                UGGA
      Grug!

Ugga covers Sandys ears.


                GRUG       Yes.  And one day, while she was in a 
       tree, the curious little bear wanted to 
       climb to the top.

                THUNK
       Wha?


                GRUG
       And no sooner than she climbed to the 
       top, she saw something new and died.

Grug SWATS the painting.

                THUNK
       Just like that?

                GRUG
       Yes!  Her last moments of terror still 
       frozen on her face.

Grug holds out Krispy Bear.  The family is terrified. 

                GRAN
       Oh, same ending as everyday.

                THUNK
            (freaked out)
       I get it, dad.  I get it.  I will never 
       do anything new or different.

                GRUG
       Good man, Thunk.

Pan across the walls to reveal they are covered with 
stories all seemingly with the same ending.  

                UGGA
       Alright, everyone sharpen your teeth and 
       lets pile up.

All their worst fears confirmed, the Croods snuggle into 
one big heap, warm and comfy.  Grug casts a glance to 
Eeps ledge.  She doesnt budge.

FADE TO BLACK:

SEQ. 500 - FOLLOW THE LIGHT


INT. CROOD CAVE - NIGHT

The Croods sleep peacefully in their pile.  Except Eep, 
who tosses restlessly on her LEDGE.  Outside, we hear the 
ROARS and HOWLS of prehistoric creatures fighting.  

But then, SILENCE.

And then cutting through the primordial night is a 
MUSICAL SOUND.  Unsettling.  Unearthly.  Eep creeps 
around her sleeping family and cautiously approaches the 
door to peer outside, when suddenly--

WHOOSH!  A bright light blazes through the gaps around 
the boulder door, bathing Eep in an OTHER-WORLDLY GLOW. 
She chases the flash of light around the cave trying to 
catch it in her hands.

Eep presses her face against the cold boulder, trying to 
get a look at what is outside, but she cant get more 
than a blurred glimpse of the canyon beyond - and the 
disappearing light.  

Desperate to see more, Eep braces her back against the 
cave and PUSHES the plug rock with her legs.  Slowly, she 
shifts the rock, careful not to wake her father. It takes 
all of her strength, but she manages to move it just 
enough for her to BARELY SQUEEZE out.  

EXT. CROOD CANYON - CONTINUOUS

Eep stands outside at night for the first time ever.  Her 
heart races.  The hot night wind blows against her face 
and through her hair.  The forbidden sensation is 
exhilarating.  

The canyon beyond is quickly swallowing the light - it 
will be gone in another few seconds.  With one of her 
hands pressed tightly to the cave door, she steels 
herself.

Eep LETS GO and DASHES after the light, SCRAMBLING 
through the SANDSTONE NARROWS, bounding from side to 
side.  As she disappears into the darkness of the canyon, 
we...

CUT TO:

EXT. CANYON

The light ahead is growing brighter.  Eep is closing on 
it.  In her excitement, she missteps and SNAPS a stick 
underfoot.  


It was barely audible.  Eep instinctively FREEZES.  

A huge SHADOW of a TUSKED CREATURE is cast on the wall 
above her.  Eep throws a rock at the shadow.

She POWERS STRAIGHT UP the stone wall with unexpected 
speed.

The Creature RUNS.  Eep tops the wall and...

CUT TO:

SEQ. 550 - CLOSE ENCOUNTERS

EXT. ROCK ARCH - NIGHT

Eep steps into a small clearing.  Stuck in the ground, is 
a TORCH.  As far as Eep knows, this is the thing she was 
following.  Eep crouches down and cautiously approaches.

REVERSE ANGLE - Eep can feel the heat from the fire on 
the palms of her hands and her face.  TENSE.  EXCITING.

But camouflaged against the rock wall behind her, 
something MOVES.  A WARTHOG CREATURE stands upright and 
creeps up behind her.

Eep reaches out to TOUCH the flame. The torch blows away 
from her.  The wind has changed direction. The breeze at 
her back, Eep smells the Creature behind her.  On her 
face, awe turns to determination as she wheels and grabs 
the creature.  She THROWS and FLIPS it over her shoulder.  
It hits the torch, knocking it to the ground.  Eep jumps 
back, GRABBING a good-sized rock - shes poised to bash 
the Creatures brains in.

                CREATURE
       Nuh!  Nuh!


The Creature defensively raises its arms, hands in front 
of its face.

                GUY
       No!


Hands? Eep GASPS, shocked to see HUMAN HANDS attached to 
this monstrosity.  

The Creature slowly puts his hands to the sides of his 
grotesque head, and RAISES its mask.  Its a boy... hes 
BEAUTIFUL!  This is GUY.

                EEP
       Augh!


Eep LEAPS BACK a few paces, DROPPING the rock on Guys 
foot.

                GUY
       AAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHH!

                EEP
       Shhh!


Eep moves swiftly to silence him.  She POUNCES on him and 
TWISTS his head sideways.  Guy is SUFFOCATING.  He feels 
around for a stick and BASHES Eep in the side of the 
head.

                EEP 
     Ow!

                GUY
            (gasping)
      Air.

                EEP
       ...You talk.


                GUY
       Im a person, like you.

Eep TOSSES the boulder aside and LIFTS Guy with one hand.

                GUY 
       Sort of... like you.

Eep OPENS Guys mouth and pokes around inside.  She 
SNIFFS at him.  Turns him upside-down.  

                GUY 
       Okay, could you not, hee hee hee, that 
       tickles.  Hey!

Eep looks closely at BELT, a sloth wrapped around Guys 
waist.  Belts eyes OPEN.

                EEP
       Augh!


Eep DROPS Guy on his head.

 
                GUY
      OW!  Wow. --

Eep jams her foot over Guys mouth.  


                EEP
       Quiet!  Im not supposed to be out here.

Guy BITES her foot.

                EEP 
       OW!


She KICKS Guy in the stomach.  He ROLLS sideways.  Guy is 
getting the worst of this encounter.  Eep kicks Guy off-
frame.  We HEAR the fight continuing.

CUT TO:

INT. CROOD CAVE

Grug is awakened by wind coming from the cave opening.  
He pushes the sleep pile off of him.  Checks Eeps 
ledge...  but she is gone. 

                GRUG
            (to Ugga)
       Eeps gone.  

 
                UGGA
      What?  Grug!

                GRUG
       Stay in the cave!

Grug stands outside the entrance to the cave.  Peering 
into utter darkness.  He steels himself... and then 
releases his hand from the door.

Guy is still on his knees.

                GUY
            (in pain, defeated)
       Wow.  Youre really strong.

The flame DWINDLES.  Guy MOVES toward it.  Eep BLOCKS 
him.

                EEP
       No!  It's mine.  No, no.  I caught it!

No way Guy is getting past her.

                GUY
       It's dying.  I can fix it!

Eep doesnt want to.

                GUY 
       Please.  I hate the dark.

Eep sees a kindred spirit.  She gets out of his way.  Guy 
PICKS UP the torch and BLOWS.  Eep scoots closer to Guy, 
staying in the circle of light around him.  As Guy brings 
the fire back to life, the relief on his face is familiar 
to Eep.  This boy seems to have power over light itself.  
Eep is smitten.

                EEP
       It does what you tell it?

                GUY
       Well, yeah, sort of.

  
                EEP
     The sun?

                GUY
       No, no. Fire.

                EEP
            (to the flame)
       Hi, fire.

                GUY
            (laughing)
       It's not alive.

                EEP
       But you said it was dying.

 
                GUY
      Uh sorry,--

                EEP
       It comes from where you come from?

                GUY
       No.  I make it.

Eep BALLS her fist, GRABBING Guy tightly by the hair.

                EEP
       Make some for me.

                GUY
       Ow.  Okay, it doesnt come out of me.

                EEP
       Make.  MAKE!  MAKE IT!

Eep SQUEEZES Guy like a tube of toothpaste.

                GUY
       You do this a lot.

Something CRACKS.  Eep DROPS Guy - hes broken.

                EEP
       Are you dead?  Can I have your fire if 
       youre dead?

Belt RUBS two flat rocks together and places them on 
Guys chest like defibrillator paddles.  Guy BOLTS 
upright.

                GUY
       Hey, those are cold!

                BELT
       Squirf!


                GUY
       You think?  Listening shells, activate.

Belt AND Guy use shells to LISTEN to the ground.

                GUY 
       I concur.  Tiger girl, we need to leave 
       immediately.

He tries to pull her by the arm.  She stays put like an 
anchor.

                EEP
       I dont even know you. 

                GUY
            (pained, rushed)
       Ow.  Im Guy.  

 
                EEP
      Guy?

                GUY
       And this is Belt.  Cook, 
       conversationalist, navigator, also keeps 
       my pants up.


                BELT
       Hhiiyaa! Yaaa!

                EEP
       What are pants up?

 
                GUY
       Who are you?


                EEP
      Eep.

                GUY
            (cutting her off)
       Let me clarify, Eep.  The world is 
       ending. 

    
                EEP
   What?

                GUY
       Im calling it... 
            (very dramatic)
       The... End.  

                BELT
       Da da daaaaa.

                EEP
       How do you know?

Guy and Belt both do gestures to accompany the Da da
daaaa.  It seems very important to them.

                GUY
       Ive seen it.  Its coming this way.  
       First, the Earth is going to shake.  Then 
       it breaks open.  Everything falls in.  
       Fire.  Lava.  I dont mean to sound too 
       dramatic, but Aaaaaaaugh.  Believe me, 
       everything were standing on, all this 
       right here, will be gone.

Again with the gestures.  Its a little weird to Eep.

                GUY 
       Weve got to get to high ground. I know a 
       mountain, that way--

He points into the distance.


                GUY 
       Its our only chance.
            (extending his hand)
       Come with me.

Guy and Belt reach out their hands to Eep.

                EEP
       I cant.


Guy hands the shell to Eep.  And Eep is mesmerized.  Guy 
pulls his hog-mask back down.

                GUY
       Okay.  Here.  If you survive, call me.

Eep test-blows the shell.  It makes a sound, she giggles.  
When she looks up to thank Guy, he is GONE.

                EEP
       Thank you.  Hello?  Hey!

Eep BUMPS directly into Grug.

                EEP 
       Dad!


                GRUG
       Are you hurt?  What took you?

                EEP
       Nothing. I left on my own.

                GRUG
       You... youuuuuuu... ww-what!?

                EEP
       Dad, let me explain...

A low GROWL interrupts them.

ON THE BEAR OWL Sniffing around.  It passes over a log.

CRANE DOWN to reveal Grug hanging under the log by one 
hand, Eep dangling in the other.

                EEP 
            (whispered)
       You never let me talk.

SEQ. 610 - EARTHQUAKE

EXT. CANYON - OUTSIDE THE KEYHOLE - MORNING

Grug and Eep move up the canyon.  Eep furiously kicks a 
rock, it nearly hits Grug.

 
                GRUG
      Hey!

Things are tense between the two.  At the KEYHOLE, they 
are met by the rest of the Croods.

 
                UGGA
      Eep!

                EEP
       Mom!

       Grug!  What happened!?

                GRUG
       You know what, I am so mad right now, 
       that I cant talk to her.

                UGGA
       Eep?  

                EEP
       Youll never believe it.  I found 
       something new.

 
                CROODS
      New?!!!!

The Croods all SNATCH up stones.  They form a defensive 
circle.

                GRUG
       News a big problem!

Eep is trapped in the middle of the defensive formation.  
She SQUEEZES out.

                EEP
       Wait.  Wait!


                UGGA
       Eep.  Stay inside the family kill circle.

                EEP
       It wasnt bad.

                GRUG
       New is always bad.

                EEP
       No.  He was nice.

                GRUG
       What!?  Excuse me?  He?

                EEP
       Oh.  Well, I thought he was a warthog, 
       but then he turned into a boy.

                GRAN
       Strange.  Usually its the reverse.

Grug RAISES an eyebrow.

                THUNK
       Eeps got a boy hog!  Eeps got a boy 
       hog!

Eep ELBOWS Thunk in the back of his head.

                EEP
       There was a boy.  Watch, okay.  Im gonna
       call him.

Eep pulls out the SHELL.  She BLOWS into the shell - the 
sound ALARMS the Croods.

They SMACK the shell from Eeps hand and SMASH it with 
their rocks.  

Eep is incredulous.  The dust clears - the panting Croods 
are satisfied the object is gone.

                EEP 
       What is wrong with you?

                GRUG
       It was dangerous.

                EEP
            (very angry)
       It was beautiful.  You want to see 
       dangerous?  Here.

She pelts Thunk with a rock.

                THUNK
       Owww!  My sniffer!

                GRUG
       Okay Eep, thats it.  Were going back to 
       the cave and youre going to stay in 
       there until youre older than... her!

                EEP
       What!?  You cant keep me inside forever!

Eep throws a tantrum of epic proportion.  She SLAMS a 
rock on the ground.  It SHATTERS to dust.

CREAK!  A strange GROAN is heard from under the ground.  
Then a small amount of sand falls from up above.  A crack 
starts to splinter under their feet.  

                EEP 
       He said this would happen.

Then BOOM!  The ground starts to SHAKE!  

                GRUG
       Get to the cave!  GO!

The Croods RACE through the CANYON NARROWS, fighting 
their way through falling boulders and shifting ground, 
heading towards the safety of their cave.

The Croods see the cave entrance.  The canyon walls above 
their home start to crack.  Grug sees that the falling 
rock will crush the cave.

                GRUG 
       Look out! Stop!

Grug leaps and tackles his family, protecting them from 
the mass of rocks crashing down.

The top of the canyon collapses and the Croods cave is 
destroyed. Everything is engulfed by dust. The earth 
settles.

SEQ. 710 - CROSSING OVER

The dust clears a bit - the Croods are in a tight ball, 
covered by Grug.  Grug stands, all Croods were sheltered 
and safe under his mighty arms.

DISSOLVE TO:

                GRUG 
       Is everyone okay?

                UGGA
       Yes.  Grug, the cave, its gone.  

Grug looks back to Crood cave.  It is gone.

                GRUG
       No.


Grug searches the rubble for any sign that the cave might 
still be there.  He finds one handprint, split in two.  

He carefully fits them back together.  Emotional, he 
lowers his head.  

As Eep steps forward, a shaft of light filtering through 
the dusty veil from the wreckage crosses her face--

As the dust descends, Eep sees A NEW WORLD beyond.

                EEP
       You really need to see this...

The dumbfounded Croods stare in awe at the beautiful 
world.

The Croods look out at the new world.

                EEP 
       We should go there!

                GRUG
       No.  No one is going anywhere. 

Grug pulls Eep back from the precipice.  

                GRUG 
       What else did that boy say?

WHOOSH! Suddenly, bursting from the New World is a giant 
flying creature - a TURTLE DOVE.

The Croods reel back as it sails overhead.  They turn to 
watch the Turtle Dove as it flies away.  

They hear a familiar menacing growl.  Its the BEAR OWL!

It roars and charges toward the Croods.  

Grug instinctively GRABS a giant boulder and rolls it in 
front of his family.  

The Bear Owl runs and swats the massive boulder away like 
a ball of yarn.   

But the Croods are not behind it.  They are running 
towards the New World.
 
                UGGA
       Grug?

                GRUG 
       Just go!  Go!  Go!

The Croods run towards the precipice with the Bear Owl 
closing in.  

They reach the edge.  The Bear Owl dives.  

The Croods LEAP.  They hang for a moment and begin 
tumbling down a steep jungle hill.

CUT TO:

SEQ. 776 - NEW WORLD

EXT. NEW WORLD. DAY

The Croods tumble through a twisty mess of giant roots 
and strange plants and land in a heap.  They all lie on 
their backs, disoriented, but momentarily calm.  

Grug sits up first. He turns to the high, high, cliff 
above them -- to the top, where they have lived all their 
lives up to this moment. A few loose pebbles continue to 
tumble down.  There is no sign of the BEAR OWL.

The others stand up, and they take in this new place.

Grug takes a deep breath and then quickly counts:

                GRUG
       One, two, three, four, five --

BEAT.  Grug smiles.

Gran lands in a heap behind him.  

                GRUG 
            (defeated)
       Six.

                GRAN
            (winces in pain)
       Oh... Where are we?

                GRUG
       I dont know, Im not sure.  Down.  In a 
       lower place.  One things for sure, we 
       cant go back the way we came.


The Croods SIT UP.  They are disoriented.

ON SANDY

                SANDY
       *Sniff sniff sniff*
       *Grrrrrrrrrrr.....*

                UGGA
            (hushed, urgent)
       Sandy?  What is it?

Sandy LUNGES at something almost disappearing into a 
bush.

Grug BARELY catches Sandy by her leg. Grug PULLS her back 
like a dog on a leash.  

                GRUG
       No, no!  Come back, Sandy!

Sandy has a MOUSEPHANT in her mouth.  Grug knocks it from 
Sandys mouth. A gaggle of mousephants run out from the 
bush and scurry away.

                GRUG 
            (tense whisper)
       We cant be out in the open like this.  
       We need a cave.  Now step where I step. 

They start moving.

                GRUG 
            (whispers)
       Okay.  Stay quiet.  Hopefully nothing big 
       knows were here yet.

PULL BACK - a huge colorful predator, THE MACAWNIVORE
senses something.  He SITS UP and STALKS OFF.

ON THE CROODS moving fitfully through the strange forest.

                GRUG 
       Wait.  Okay.  Wait.  Okay.  Wait.  Okay.

The Croods cautiously move in fits and stops through the 
middle of this thick, pre-historic rainforest.

                THUNK
            (rambling)
       So Dad, just to be clear, are we looking 
       for the exact same cave?  
       If it was me, Im just throwing this out 
       there, if it was me choosing the cave, I 
       would go with a smaller cave.

As they trek, strange creatures (BEAR PEARS, PUNCH 
MONKEYS) watch these foreigners.  

In the front of the line, Grug is freaked out.  But in 
the back Eep is taking in the wonders.  They pass through 
a curtain of hefty hanging pears.  After they pass the 
pears all turn to watch the Croods.  

A leaf FLUTTERS down.  

 
                GRUG
      Wait.

Eep and Grug LOOK UP.

WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY PUNCH 
MONKEYS.

 
                THUNK
      Dad?

                GRUG
       Ill take care of this.

Grug launches into his Threat Display - 

                GRUG 
       WWAAAAaaarrgghhaarrraaaarrgghhh!!

He flails his arms around and jumps about in front of the 
nearest Punch Monkey.  No reaction from the Punch Monkey.

Grug stops, confused The Punch Monkey now breaks into a 
BROAD GRIN Then hauls off and - THUD - Punches Grug in 
the face!  Grug reels back, surprised - turns Right into 
another Punch Monkey. It winds up and - THUD! - it hits 
Grug - Grug reels back - into another Monkey - THUD! -

                THUNK
       Alright dad, go get em!  Oh, oh, now you 
       got em-- Now theyre really hitting you.  
       Dad I got it, just stop running into 
       their fists.

Gran joins in and punches Grug in the nose.

                GRAN
       Hah, Im loving this.


                UGGA
       Grug, when youre done, we should get 
       going.  

Wide shot: Grug is being bounced back and forth like a 
pinball from one punch Monkey to the next.  The Punch 
Monkeys are whooping and hollering - this is great fun!  
The Punch Monkeys let go of Grug and begin running away 
for no apparent reason.

Grug staggers backwards into the family. 

                GRUG
       Thats right! You cant get past this!

 
                CHUNKY
      ROOOAR!

A colorful 'bush' rears up - it's not a bush, it's a 
MACAWNIVORE!  The Croods react, terrified 

Grug throws a rock at it.  The Macawnivore catches the 
rock and SPRINGS! - 

 
                CROODS
      *gasps*

                GRUG
       Climb!  Climb!  Climb!

Grug pushes and forces the Croods up a huge tree then as 
it steps away-- it is actually a giant animal.

GRUG'S POV: A cave!

                GRUG 
       CAVE! GO! GO!  

The Croods jump off the bird leg in hopes of getting to 
the cave.

                GRUG 
       Come on! Hurry up, lets go! Come on!

The Croods all RUN LIKE CRAZY in the direction Grug 
pointed. They step inside the cave.  SLAM!  The front 
of the cave comes down.  The Croods have jumped inside 
the MOUTH of a LAND WHALE!

                THUNK
       Hey look!  This cave has a tongue.  
       Awesome!

CUT TO:

SEQ. 1250 - GUY TO THE RESCUE

The Land Whale stands up and then SPITS the Croods out 
through its blow hole.  The Croods land in a heap. 

                GRUG
       Okay, thats one, two, three, four, 
       five... six...

                GRAN 
       And seven... if were counting Chunky the 
       Death Cat.
 

                CHUNKY
      Grrrrrrrrr.

The Macawnivore appears from behind some nearby grass.  
It looks at the Croods with delight.  Suddenly, the 
shadow of the setting sky passes over the Macawnivore.  
It freaks out and retreats into the forest. 

                THUNK
       Hah!  Its scared of the dark... wait... 
       were scared of the dark.

And for good reason, because as the SHADOW from the 
setting sun falls across the Croods.

Suddenly, thousands of PIRANHA OWLS BURST from the 
grasses around the Croods and form a huge undulating 
cloud above them. Its a beautiful sight.

The cloud of Piranha Owls then SETTLE on a massive LAND 
WHALE.  

Moments later, they fly back into the air - the whale is 
SKELETONIZED.  It CRUMPLES to the ground.

                GRUG
       Kill circle!


The Croods form their defensive circle, brandishing 
rocks.

Eep spies a SKULL lying in the sand.  She SPRINTS for it.

                GRUG 
       Eep!  Eeeep!


Eep breaks a horn from the skull and BLOWS on it loud and 
long.

ON GUY hearing the horn.  He is happy to hear the sound, 
knowing its Eep calling him.

Then as Guy begins walking towards the sound, Guy notices 
the circling birds in the sky.  Alarmed, he DASHES off.

Guy appears at the treeline. He spots Eep standing alone 
in the clearing.  He sees the birds heading towards her.  
He runs and leaps off a ROCK OUTCROPPING jumping right 
over the CROODS who are huddled near the ROCK.

Guy lands and in one fluid motion knocking the horn out 
of Eeps hand to stop the noise then STRIKES a spark with 
two STONES. The birds close in, blotting out the 
remaining light.  All goes BLACK.

Then, a tiny leaf of flame FLUTTERS to life before Guy.  
He THROWS two more handfuls of grass on it, and it FLARES 
UP!  The light SPLITS the onrushing red tide of birds 
like a knife.  For a few moments the Croods are inside a 
TORNADO of the tiny monsters.  The mass PASSES.

Grug SLAPS at one last smoldering bird FLUTTERING past.

Grug TURNS to see Guy, HOLDING his daughter.  Grugs 
expression DARKENS.  He SNARLS.

                GUY
       Ta-da.


                EEP
       (Sigh.)


Grug pushes Eep aside and shows Guy his threat display.

                GRUG
       Auughhauhhhgggh!

SEQ. 1275 - FIRE GOOD, FIRE BAD

Suddenly, Guy and Eep are circled by the Croods.  They 
are in defensive ape-like positions.  Each doing their 
threat display.

                               SMASH CUT TO:


                CROODS
       Raaarr, 
       grOooOOOOowwllll,  
       ERF ERF  
       GLaaabbbllllellelller!

Guy stands in front of Eep defensively.

  
   
                GUY
     Cavies!

                EEP
    Cavies?

                GUY
       Cavemen!  Stand back!  Theyre 
       practically animals.  See their bony, 
       sloping foreheads?

    
                EEP
   Oh... yeah!

                GUY
       The huge primitive teeth?

                EEP
       Er... yeah...

                GUY
       The excessive body hair?  Oh, that ones 
       got a tail...

                EEP
       Uhhh... yeah...

Guy PULLS his knife.

                GUY
       Close your eyes.  Im going to have to 
       take their lives.

                EEP
            (slapping the knife away)
       No.  It wont help.
            (embarrassed)
       Theyre my family.

                GUY
       What?

Eep nods toward Thunk.

                THUNK
       Ah, the sun is in his hands!


The Croods keep circling.

                EEP
       No.  No.  Its fire.  

                UGGA
       Where did it come from?

                EEP
            (proudly)
       He made it.

Grug grabs him and squeezes him tight.

                GRUG
       Make some for me!

                EEP
       It doesnt come out of him.

                GRUG
       Make.  Make it.

POP!  Guys ribs are cracked for the second time.

                GUY
       You know, youre a lot like your 
       daughter.

Guy falls in a heap.

                EEP
       Great, now hes broken.

                UGGA 
       Oh, its a baby sun.

Grug turns to see Ugga, Thunk, Gran and Sandy are now 
sitting very close around the fire, transfixed.

                GRUG
       Whoa!  Stay back.  We dont know what it 
       wants.

As Grug moves around the circle, picking up sitting 
Croods and placing them a safe distance from the fire, he 
talks to them like a kindergarten teacher:

                GRUG 
       Now well all sit here, and wait for the 
       sun to come back.  And tomorrow well 
       find a new cave, and pretend today never 
       happened.  

                GRUG 
            (looks at the fire)
       Isnt this fun, Eep?


Grug looks around to see that Eep is kneeling beside Guy.

                GRUG 
       Eep, dont touch him.  Goodness knows 
       where hes been.

Suddenly, behind Grug, Sandy ATTACKS the torch.  She 
shakes it with her teeth, EMBERS FLY EVERYWHERE.

                THUNK
       Dad, Sandys hurting fire.

Grug reaches down and scoops up Sandy.  (NOTE:  From this 
point, Grug will hold onto Sandy, no matter how much she 
struggles, kicks and bites.)

                GRUG
       Sandy! No! Fire is not a play thing!

                UGGA
       Aww, what a cute little guy.

                GRUG
       Hey, stay back.

The Croods snatch at the embers as they dance in the air 
around them.  

                GRUG 
       No, no, no, wait!

One of the embers has caught onto Thunks tunic.

                THUNK
       It likes me!
            (after a beat)
       Hey!  ITS BITING ME!!  

Thunk takes off running like a maniac.   

The flame explodes into embers, which starts more fires 
in the grass around him. Grug looks at the growing fires 
with utter confusion.  

                THUNK 
            (screaming)
       Ow! Youre not my friend.  Stop, stop 
       touching me!

                GRUG
       Thunk!  Uh, try hiding from it in the 
       tall dry grass!

Thunk sprints through the grass, arms flailing, as a ring 
of fire blazes up.

                THUNK
            (pleading with fire)
       Stop please, please.  Im only nine.

Gran cackles at her grandsons misfortune, but then she 
realizes her WALKING STICK IS ON FIRE.  

Angrily, Gran starts to slam the burning end of the stick 
on the ground, trying to put it out.  

But she only ends up making more small fires.

                UGGA
       Ooh, more fire babies.

While Gran tries desperately to save her cane, Ugga 
starts throwing sticks on the small fires, which begin to 
grow in size.

EEP AND GUY.

                EEP
       Hi.

                GUY
       So, your Dad, hes trying to kill me.

                EEP
       Yeah.  But I wont let him.

CUT TO:

CUT TO:

Eep and Guy witness the FIERY MAYHEM:

                GRUG 
       Hold on son, come back!

SERIES OF SHOTS:

GRUG is chasing THUNK in circles, throwing rocks at his 
flaming butt.

                THUNK
       I dont like you anymore!


Sandy, who is still in Grugs arms, but facing 
backwards, is now holding onto a burning stick and 
lighting everything she passes on fire.

   
                SANDY
    Weeeee!!!!

Gran, who is still trying to put out her stick, is 
batting it into every tree and bush she can hit.

                GRAN
       Get out!  Out!

Ugga carries a REDWOOD above her head and then tosses 
it onto the small fire.  

                UGGA
       Eat up, babies!

WHOOSH! Ugga ignites a massive bonfire.  

The Croods appear like a bunch of violent, lunatic 
pyromaniacs.

CLOSE ON GRAN

Gran is pounding her walking stick on the ground.

PULL BACK TO REVEAL - she is standing on the edge of a 
giant corn field that is slowly catching on fire.  

  
                GRAN
     Die!  Die!

POOF! The fire on her cane has finally gone out.  

 
                GRAN 
      I win!

She smiles.  And then WA-POP!

The giant ear of corn explodes blasting Gran off frame 
who slams into Thunk.  The speeding ear picks up Ugga, 
Grug.

ON EEP AND GUY

                EEP
       Theyre not so scary once you get to know 
       them.

Eep and Guy are HIT by the speeding corn.


                GUY
       Who are you people?

                UGGA
       Oh, Im sorry.  Were the Croooooods!  
       And you are?

                GUY
       Uh, Guy.


                CROODS
            (waving)
       Hi, Guy.

The speeding ear CRASHES into a lone tree, sending Guy 
and the Croods sprawling across the tundra.  The flying 
ears ROCKET SKYWARD and BURST like colorful fireworks.

                THUNK
       Wow!  Looks like magic.  And smells like 
       food.

Popcorn kernels RAIN DOWN upon the Croods.  They are 
BURIED.

                GRUG
       Dont eat it, its new.

DISSOLVE TO:

SEQ. 1425 - THE GOAL IS SET

The Croods burst out of a mountain of popcorn.



                CROODS
       Still alive!

ON THE BASE OF THE POPCORN PILE

                GUY (0.S.)
       Come on, keep eating.  



                BELT
       Squirf!

Guy BURROWS out the side of the popcorn pile like a 
prisoner escaping Alcatraz.

                GUY
       *gasping for air*
            (checks to see if hes been 
            spotted)

                EEP
       Hey, wheres Guy?

Guy RUNS for the mountain.  Eep POUNCES on Guy like a 
tiger. 



                GUY
       No!

                EEP
       Going somewhere?

                GUY
       The mountain?  High ground?  End of the 
       world, remember? 

                EEP
       That already happened.  It destroyed our 
       cave.

                GUY
            (struggling)
       Noooo. That was just the beginning of the 
       end.  The end of the end is still coming.

                GRUG
            (as if to a dog)
       Eep.  Drop it.

Eep SETS him down.  Guy BOLTS but discovers Eep hasnt 
let go of his hand.  Guy is YANKED backwards like hes 
been tied to a piling.

                EEP
       We cant let him go!  What if we dont 
       find a cave before sunset?  What if it 
       takes a few days?  What if the birds come 
       back? 

BEAT.

                GRAN
       We need his fire, dummy!

WHOOSH!  Grug grabs Guy and throws him in a log.

                GRUG
       Fine.  Youre staying with us till we 
       find a cave.

Grug hoists Guy in the log onto his shoulder.


Grug moves out, AWAY from the mountain.  The family falls 
in behind Grug.  Thunk is carrying a huge piece of 
popcorn that hes snacking on.

                GUY
       What?  No Im not.  Dont make me part of 
       this.  Stay here if you want, but let me 
       go.  Ive got a dream, a mission, a 
       reason to live.

                EEP
            (brightly)
       Not anymore.

                GUY
            (thinking fast)
       Umm... Ive got an idea.  Lets go to 
       that mountain.

ON THE TALL MOUNTAIN way in the distance.

                GRUG
            (barely looks)
       Its too far.

                EEP
       Dad really has his heart set on a cave.

                GUY
       Uh, there, are, caves on that mountain.

                EEP
       Have you been there?

                GUY
       Its a mountain.  Mountains are safe.  
       Mountains have caves.  And water.  And 
       sticks. 

                THUNK
       Mom?  Did you hear that?  I can get my 
       own stick!

                GUY
       Yes.  Sticks.  Caves and sticks.  Crazy 
       sticks.  Lets go.

On cue, a RUMBLE. This gets Grugs attention.  Grug 
STOPS.  The Croods wait to see whats going to happen 
next. A Mammoth FALLS out of sight, SWALLOWED by the 
ground.

                BELT
       Da da daaaaa.

Sandy tries to attack Belt.

                THUNK
       Ugh.  That thing is weird.

Belt antagonizes Sandy by sticking his tongue out at her. 
Sandy goes at Belt again.

                EEP
       No no, its okay Sandy.  Thats just a 
       belt.

 Grug takes a step back.  Turns. 

                GRUG
       Ive made a decision.  Were going to, 
       that mountain!  Dont ask me why.  Its 
       just a hunch.  It just feels right.

                UGGA
       I dont know Grug.  Weve never really 
       walked that far.

                THUNK
       I dont think my feet can do that.

                GRAN
       Ill never live long enough to get there.

                GRUG
            (lighting up) 
       Lets do it.
            (pause)
       Oh come on, just think.  Our whole 
       family, packed together on a long, slow 
       trip across country?  Days and nights 
       with just each other.  Well tell 
       stories.  Well laugh.
            (glancing at Eep)
       Well become closer as a family.

Eep RAISES one eyebrow.

SEQ. 1460 - FAMILY ROAD TRIP

EXT. BURNT OUT SHRUBS

SMASH CUT TO:

The Croods have not traveled far.  The camera starts 
tight in on Thunk and Sandy.  Sandy is harassing Thunk.

                THUNK
       Aaaaaaaaugh.  Get her off.  Get off.

                UGGA
       If youre not ready to challenge her, 
       then dont look her in the eye.

We follow Sandy as she moves past Gran. 

                GRAN
       Could you keep your big giant arms on 
       your side of the trail!

Sandy moves past Ugga, Eep and Guy who is still stuck in 
the log and being carried by Grug.

                UGGA
       No more touching.  No more touching.

                EEP
       Isnt this fun?  Were taking our first 
       trip together.

Thunk accidentally bumps into Eep.

                EEP 
       Stop shoving, or I will pull out your 
       tongue!

                GRUG
       Do you want me to turn this family 
       around?  Do you?!  Because I will turn 
       this family around so fast!

The camera slowly pulls out from the family in chaos as 
they walk across the burned out landscape.

X-DISS TO:

The Croods are traveling across the dry land.  The camera 
has pulled out from the family as they travel.  Family 
chaos continues.  

                THUNK
       Dad, I gotta go!

                GRUG
       Come on, you can hold it.

                THUNK
       I dont think so. 

THUNK MOANS

                THUNK 
            (near tears)
       I gotta go really bad.


Thunk starts to HOP WITH HIS KNEES GLUED TO EACH OTHER.

                GRUG
            (relinquishing)
       Go behind one of those lumpy things and 
       make it fast.

                THUNK
       Ow!  Something bit me!

                GRAN
            (loud)
       I don't blame it.

                UGGA
       Maybe we should have stopped for water.

X-DISS TO:

A Liyote turns to watch the Croods as they travel.

                EEP
       Dad, can I take a turn carrying him?



        		GRUG
         No.      

                EEP
       How about now?



                GRUG
       No.

                EEP
       Now?

                GRUG
       No.

                EEP
       NOW?!?!

                GRUG
       NO!

                EEP
       (even louder) NOW?!?!

                GRUG
       I can do this all day long.  No, no, no, 
       and still no.

X-DISS TO:


Oh yeah, more traveling.  Now we are in the Turkeyfish
hunting grounds.  The camera is so far away the Croods 
are only a speck in the frame.  

SMASH CUT TO:

Grug, exhausted, in the foreground with family chaos over 
his shoulder.

                GRAN
       Im not dying on an empty stomach.

                UGGA
       Grug, were all pretty tired.

                THUNK
       Im pretty dizzy, so Im just going to 
       lay down for a minute.

                GRUG
       Well eat when we get there.

                GRAN
       Its taking too long!  Im grabbing a 
       snack.

Gran jumps up and tries to grab Belt.  Belt pulls a bone 
knife and defends himself.

                GUY
       No. No. No. Dont do that.  He will cut 
       you.  Thats not food, hes a pet.  My 
       pet.

                GRAN
       Whats a pet?

                GUY
       An animal that you dont eat.

                GRAN
       We call those children.

                GRUG
       No man should have a pet.  Its weird, 
       and wrong.  Its--
            (spies giant bird)
       ...Its food!

                GUY
       No, no please!

                GRUG
       Not that.  That.

CUT TO:

SEQ. 1075 - FOOD FIXES EVERYTHING

A WHOOPING sound comes from the grasses ahead.  A giant 
TURKEY FISH raises its toothy head.

                GRUG 
       Food fixes everything.  

Grug grabs Thunk.

                GRUG 
       Alright, show me your hunting face.


                THUNK
       Arrgh.


Eep shows her hunting face.

                GRUG
       Not you!  Youre still grounded!

                GRUG 
       Come on, Thunk.

                THUNK
       My feet hurt.

ON GUY

Leaning against a rock next to Gran, Sandy, Eep and Ugga.  
Guy notices Eep is agitated.  She STARES in the direction 
the men went.

                GUY
       You look tense.

                EEP
       Im not tense.

                GRAN
       Angry girl wants to be doing what theyre 
       doing.

                THUNK
       Ow! I wasnt ready!

Thunk CRASHES THROUGH the bushes, PURSUED by the Turkey 
Fish.  Grug is being DRUG behind.

                GRUG 
       Hang on Thunk, Im coming!

                THUNK
       Why are you doing this?

                GUY
       What are they doing?

      
                UGGA
 	Hunting.

                THUNK
       Get it off! You stay away from me.

                GUY
       No seriously, what are they doing?

The Turkeyfish squashes Grug into the ground. Then 
continues chasing Thunk.

                THUNK
            (to Turkey Fish)
       Youve got a ton of eggs.  Just make 
       another egg!

Thunk FLIES INTO FRAME and SPLATS against the rock.  The 
Turkey Fish climbs to the top of a nearby rock and dives 
off.

                THUNK 
       Now youre just rubbing it in.

ON A GIANT BRONTO SCORPION 

SLAPPED on a rock in front of the Croods.

The Bronto Scorpion suddenly STRUGGLES.

                GRUG
       There! Whos hungry for scorpion?

The Croods PULL at the legs.  They TWIST and SNAP OFF 
like lobster legs. 

                GUY
       What happened to the egg and the bird?


                THUNK
            (still punchy)
       You know, we lost him.  But when the bird 
       stepped on me and pushed me into the 
       ground, the scorpion grabbed a hold of me 
       and one thing led to another and here we 
       are eating him.  Win win.  

The dismembered legs continue to STRUGGLE.  Guy looks 
ill.

                GRAN
       Not enough.  Not enough.  I need more.  I 
       need more!

Gran looks hungrily at Guy.

                GUY
            (concerned)
       Oh, look at that.  Shes not gonna eat me 
       right?

                UGGA
       Youre too skinny.  If she was gonna eat 
       anyone it would be--

                THUNK
       AAAAAAAAAUUGHHHHHHHH!  

                THUNK 
       Owww!  Shes locked her jaw!



                UGGA
       Mom!

Sandy gets up from the table.

                THUNK
       Someone get a stick!  Get her off!

Guy looks on, horrified.

                THUNK 
       Oh you sick old monster!  Hurry!  Put the 
       stick in her mouth!

Belt gives Guy a lets get out of here look. Belt rolls 
Guy away from the family.

                GRUG
       Hold her still.  Use a rock.  Ugga would 
       you just hit her legs.

Guy LEAVES.  Eep chases him and pins him down.



                EEP
       Why are you rolling away?

                GUY
       Owww!  I just want something to eat.

                EEP
       You have bug for dinner.  Plenty of bug!

                GUY
       Please... Ill let you help me hunt.



                EEP
       Really?

                THUNK
       Ahhh! Theyre all over me... Tell my 
       story... 

EXT. GRASSLANDS - AFTERNOON

Guy lays a snare in the low grass.  He WALKS to the base 
of a rotund, spikey tree, unwinding more rope as he goes.  
He TIES the rope around the base of the tree.  Then he 
hands the loose end to Eep.  Belt stretches his arms 
WIDE.  Guy STOPS jumping and points up to the top of the 
tree.

Eep takes the cue.  She LEAPS up and grabs the leaning 
top of the tree.  Her weight gently BENDS the tree top 
down to the ground.  



                GUY
       Okay.

Guy carefully SETS the trigger.

                EEP
       What do you call this?



                GUY
       A trap.

                EEP
       What does it do?

Guy makes sound effects to get his point across as he 
describes the trap.

                GUY
            (explains with sounds)
       *soft whistle* Raargh, Thump thump thump, 
       thubububububub *soft whistle* poom!  
       Tadaaaaaa!

                EEP
       How long have you been alone?

Belt opens his arms wide showing Guy has been alone a 
long, long time.

                EEP 
       ... So what do we do?

Guy pulls out a weird miniature TURKEY FISH PUPPET.

                GUY
       Hows your acting?

ON THE TURKEY FISH getting ready to eat the TRIP-GERBILS. 
The Turkey LIFTS the creature to his mouth to DEVOUR it, 
but hes INTERRUPTED by a WHISTLING sound.  He TURNS to 
see the silly little puppet dancing about.  The Turkey 
Fish DROPS his meal and cautiously APPROACHES the puppet.

ON GUY AND EEP working the puppet.  Eep is having the 
time of her life.

                GUY 
       Oh, youre good at this.

They are so into what they are doing, they accidentally 
get TANGLED UP.

                GUY 
       Oh, sorry, I...

                EEP
       Just move your arm... no, your other arm.  
       Oh, that ones mine.

In their struggle to UNTANGLE themselves, Eep and Guy 
inadvertently insult the Turkey Fish.  It CHARGES.  Eep 
and Guy dont notice. 

The Turkey Fish MISSES the snare, LEAPS the rock and 
SNATCHES the fake bird off of Guys head, THRASHING it.

                EEP 
       Uh... It didnt step in your trap-y, 
       thing.

                GUY 
       Yeah, I noticed. 

Eep BOLDLY STANDS in front of the bird.  The Turkey Fish 
grabs Guy and tosses him high across the open field.  He 
goes flying through the air, screaming.  

ON GRUG - hearing the commotion.  Guy lands back in the 
log.



                GRUG 
       Wheres Eep?

Eep is in full parkour as she runs from the Turkeyfish.

                GUY
       Shes awesome.

Grug STEPS FORWARD.  Hes going to SPRING the trap.


                GRUG
       Eep!

                EEP
 	Dad, no!

She LEAPS the snare, PUSHING Grug DOWN. 

The Turkey Fish HITS the trigger.  The snare TRIPS.  The 
bird BITES at the cavemen, but comes up short.  The 
Turkey Fish WHOOSHES BACKWARDS into the air.  He FLIES a 
couple hundred feet up...

... and CRASHES down in a cloud of feathers.

DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. BARBECUE

ON THE TURKEY ROASTING over an open fire. It looks golden 
and juicy.  Grug is agitated.  The Croods are devouring 
the Turkey Fish.

                THUNK
       Its an avalanche of flavor.

THE CROODS are eating like wild animals.  They 
practically MAUL each other for scraps.  HOWLS and 
SNARLING fill the night air.  Guy is amazed and shocked 
at how the Croods are wolfing it down.


Guy sits to the side, his ankle roped to a heavy rock.  
Guy and Belt share a concerned LOOK as they politely eat 
their meal.  Eep comes over and sits next to Guy.

                GUY
            (to Belt)
       Looks like we wont be having any 
       leftovers.

                EEP
       What are left-overs?

                GUY
            (confused)
       You know, when you have so much food to 
       eat you have some, left over.

                EEP
       We never have that much food.

Grug is struck by Eeps words. Ugga sees Grug is hurt. 
Guy and Belt are struck by this as well.

                UGGA
       Grug, how about a story?

                GRUG
       Thats a good idea.  How about a story 
       huh?

                THUNK
       Yeah a story, tell us a story!

Croods gather around Grug.

                GRUG
       Once upon a time there was a little tiger 
       who lived in a cave with her family.  
       There were a lot of rules, but the big, 
       simple one was to never leave the cave at 
       night.  And the door was so heavy, youd 
       think it would be easy to remember.  

                THUNK
       So easy to remember!

                GRUG
       I know!  But, while everyone was asleep, 
       she went out anyway.  

 
                CROODS
      No!


                GRUG
       Yes!  And no sooner than she did, her 
       cave was destroyed and everyone had to go 
       on this long, sucky walk, with some 
       weirdo they met, and died!  The end.

                GUY
       Whoa!  I did not see that coming.  Twist 
       ending.  My stories never end like that.

                THUNK
       Yes!  Two stories in one night!

The Croods LEAVE Grug and GATHER around Guy.  Guy is 
uncharacteristically dumbstruck.  

A BEAT - 

                GUY
       Okay.  But it wont be as good as Grugs.  
       Um, once upon a time, there was a 
       beautiful tiger.  She lived in a cave 
       with the rest of her family.  Her father 
       and mother told her, You may go anywhere 
       you want but never go near the cliff, for 
       you could fall.  

                GRUG
       And die.  Good story.

Thinking the story is over, the Croods begin to get up. 
As Guy begins talking again they settle back down.

                GUY
       But when no one was looking, she would go 
       near the cliff, for the closer she came 
       to the edge, the more she could hear, the 
       more she could see, the more she could 
       feel.  Finally, she stood at the very 
       edge, and she saw a light.  She leaned 
       out to touch it, and slipped.

                GRUG
       And she fell.

                GUY
       And she flew.

    
                CROODS
   		*gasp*

                THUNK
       Where did she fly?
  
  
                GUY
     Tomorrow.

                EEP
     Tomorrow?

                GUY
       A place with more suns in the sky than 
       you can count.

                THUNK
       It would be so bright.

                GUY
       A place not like today, or yesterday, a 
       place where things are better.

                GRUG
       Tomorrow isnt a place, you cant see it!

                GUY
       Oh yes, yes it is.  Ive seen it.  Thats 
       where Im going.

Grug studies Guy.  Is he crazy?  Eep though is entranced. 
Eep and Guy lock eyes. There is something growing between 
them. Grug and Belt see it too. Grug is not thrilled.

                GRUG
       Well, WE are going to shut our eyes and 
       sleep.  And when we wake up were going 
       to find the place that has everything we 
       want.

      
     
                EEP
 	Tomorrow?!

                GRUG
  	A cave.

Grug stuffs Guy neatly back inside the log.  Grug CURLS 
UP by the fire with the LOG TUCKED UNDER HIS ARM far away 
from Eep.

DISSOLVE TO:

ON GRUGS FACE.

                GRUG
       *snoring, tossing and turning*


Morning light kisses Grugs cheeks.  Hes sound asleep.  
PULL OUT to reveal that Guys log is now teetering over a 
cliff edge - there was another subduction during the 
night, and half of the Croods sleeping platform has sunk 
two hundred feet.  Grug is still grasping Guys log, 
which now hangs over the fresh abyss, and the still-
asleep Guy is now SLIPPING out of one end.  In the nick 
of time, Grug SHIFTS position, inadvertently TURNS the 
log, and Guy starts slipping out the OTHER end.  Guy 
WAKES UP, looking down.

                GUY
       AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHH.

SMASH CUT TO:


EXT. CORAL FIELDS - MORNING

The Croods trudge behind Grug as he cautiously makes his 
way to the mountain.  Grug SNIFFS, and TESTS the ground - 
he moves like a man in a mine field.  Meaning SLOWLY.

THE LOG

Eep walks alongside Guy, who is still being carried by 
Grug in the log.

                GUY
       That was too close. It almost caught us.

                GRUG
       I was watching.  We were fine.

                GUY
       Weve got to move faster.  Do you people 
       have any other speed aside from wander? 
       Ill take a shamble at this point.

                EEP
       Hey, do you have a minute? How did the 
       tiger fly?

                GUY
       I only share when Im outside the log.  
       Im funny that way. 

                EEP
            (winking)
       Leave this to me.

Eep FALLS BACK behind Thunk, getting him between she and 
her dad.

                EEP 
       Hey Thunk, you have a spider on your 
       face.  

Eep SMASHES Thunk in the face, KNOCKING him into Grug, 
sending Guy and the log FLYING.  Grug shoots Eep an 
annoyed look.

                EEP 
            (shrugging)
       Oops.

Grug sees Guy has ROLLED away.

                GRUG
       Hes loose!

Grug goes to retrieve Guy, and STEPS on something sharp.

                GRUG 
       Aaaaahhhhhh!  Do not step on those weird, 
       pointy rocks!

                THUNK
       You mean these rocks?  Ahh owww!  Do not 
       step on these rocks!

Thunk steps on the coral - it CRUNCHES under his feet.

                GRAN 
       Step aside, girls!

Gran steps out, and then SCREAMS.

                GRUG
       Hello?  Nobodys listening!  No one is 
       listening.  You cannot walk on those!

Guy stands on the coral without flinching.

                GRUG 
       Arraughrragh come back here now.

                GRAN
       Well, there goes our chance for survival.



                THUNK
       And our log!

Grug must make the choice to go after Guy.

                GRUG
       Okay. Arraugh!

Grug cringes and bellows with every step. Guy still 
locked inside the log, hops away as fast as he can. Grug 
leaps out and grabs the log only to loosen it as Guy 
jumps to a coral patch below. 



                GUY
       Ow, ow, ow.

Guy now free runs and hides behind a giant shell.  He 
looks back at the Croods as they try in vain to cross the 
field and feels pity for Eep.

                THUNK
       Ow!  Jumping doesnt help, I mean, just 
       briefly, but it doesnt get better!  Ow!  
       Do not walk on your hands, the hands do 
       not help at all.

Guy looks back at the stranded Croods.  Then he looks 
again to the tall mountain.  Belt sees that Guy is having 
a hard time leaving the Croods. He needs to make a 
choice. Belt makes it for him.

                BELT
       Eeccoomme on!

Belt walks Guy back to the Croods

HARD CUT TO:

GUY STANDS AT THE EDGE OF THE CORAL, ONLY A FEW FEET FROM 
GRUG AND THE CROODS.  GUYS ARMS ARE FILLED WITH 
SUPPLIES.

                GUY
       I can help you, but were going to have 
       to make a few changes around here.  The 
       log ride is over.  Drop the log.

Grug grudgingly DROPS the log.

                GUY 
       Now, kick it away.

Grug BARELY NUDGES it.

    
                GUY 
   Farther.

Grug KICKS it a quarter-mile.



  
                GUY 
     Really?!

                GRUG
       Okay, smart, Guy... now what?

Guy SMILES.

HARD CUT TO:

EXT. CORAL FIELDS - LATER

Everyone is now wearing shoes -- some made of leaves, 
sponges and some are actually fish!

Ugga and Gran wobble on their new shoes.

Thunk is covering his eyes, too afraid to look down.    
Thunk looks down at his horrifying fish shoes.  They 
blink at him.

                THUNK
       Ahhhh! Good fish. 

Eep is covering her eyes.

                GUY
       Okay.  Now you can look.

Eep peers down at her new boots.

                EEP
       Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh!  I love 
       them!  Where are my feet!?

                GUY
       Theyre still there!  


                EEP
       Oh, okay.  

Eep slips, and falls into Guys arms.

                GUY
       Whoa.  Youre really 
            (getting crushed)
       ... heavy.

                EEP
       Really?  Thank you!

Grug walks over as the two fall to the ground.


                GRUG
       Hey, wait.  Whoa.  Whoa.  WHOA!!

                GUY
            (sweating)
       Okay!  Shes up.  Im good.  Were 
       good...   

                GRAN 
       These shoes are great!  Where do you get 
       these ideas?



                GUY
       Ah ha.

On cue, Belt produces a piece of chalk.  

Guy stands Thunk against a wall.  Guy stands next to him.  
Belt OUTLINES them.  Guy excitedly gestures to the 
silhouettes.

                GUY 
       Im calling it, a brain.  Im pretty sure 
       its where ideas come from.  

                THUNK
       Dad.  I dont have a brain.

                GRUG
       Weve gotten along just fine without 
       brains till now.  Cavemen dont need 
       brains.  We have these.  Heeya! Haha!
            (balls his mighty fists)
       Thats what Im talking about!  Ideas are 
       for weaklings.  

Grug punches at the air in front of Guy making him wince.

                GRUG 
       Now, lets get to that mountain.

Ugga and Eep notice each others shoes.

                UGGA/EEP
       Oh wow.  I love those!

                THUNK
       Good fish. Dont eat my feet.


CUT TO:


The Croods run, slowly at first, then faster.  And 
faster.  The shoes make the difference.  

ON THE CROODS

Grug encounters a bunch of Punch Monkeys again. He 
readies himself for a fight.

Guy hands out bananas.

Grug throws his banana to the ground only to slip on it.

ON THE CROODS

Grug sees the Macawnivore down below in the crevasse 
waiting for his Croods dinner.

Grug sees Guy making something out of sticks.

Traveling by stilts over a crevasse.

The family hobbles across a canyon on their stilts.  Guy 
helps Eep from falling.

                EEP
       So... Howd the tiger fly?

                GUY
       He jumped on the sun and rode it to 
       tomorrow.

 Grug doesnt like seeing his daughter so close to Guy.



                GRUG
       No, no, no!

The family moves across, Grug is the last to follow.

Grug spies Chunky the Death Cat below him.  Grug WHACKS 
Chunky in the face with a stilt.  

Chunky ponders the strange sticks Grug is perched on, 
then WHACKS a chunk out of them.  Grug DROPS down by a 
yard or so.  Panicking, Grug RACES across the chasm, 
losing stilt height with every SWIPE of Chunkys paw.  
Grug doesnt make it across - SNARLING and BITING sounds 
emanate from the canyon.



                GRUG 
       Ooowwwww!

The Croods stand at the top of a cliff.


Grug tries to maneuver his way down the cliff by clinging 
to the side.

Guy and the other Croods sit on a giant leaves, sledding 
down the side of the canyon past Grug.

They pass Grug up as he continues to make his way down by 
tiptoeing.  Grug stumbles and falls down the slope.

                THUNK
       Hi dad!  Bye dad!

BOOM!  A FLASH POPS against the Croods.  SWING THE CAMERA 
AROUND to reveal A HUGE STORM hanging like a purple 
curtain before them.  The Croods stop dead.  

CUT TO:

The rain line BEARS DOWN on them.

Grug tries to PUNCH the drops.  

ON EEP AND GUY

                GUY
       Youve seen rain before... right?

                EEP
       We dont get out much.

Guy opens an Umbrella to cover himself from the rain. 
Belt pulls Eep under the umbrella to be close to Guy.


                BELT
       Hmmmmm.

Belt makes an Origami boat. He and Sandy sail across the 
rain puddles. 

Grug seeing Guy and Eep snuggling under the umbrella, 
grabs the umbrella away from Guy. Grug gets hit by 
lightning.

The rest of the Croods open their umbrellas to take cover 
as they enjoy the RAIN.

ON THE CROODS UNDULATING REFLECTION 

The Croods stand on a tiny island in a shallow ocean - 
Eep is pointing at her own reflection.

                GRUG
            (frustrated)
       Eep, looks dangerous.

                EEP
       Oh dad, you say that about everything.

Eep goes to jump in the water.  Guy STOPS her.



                GUY
       Careful.

                EEP
       Oh really?  Okay. 

Guy CANNONBALLS.  Then SURFACES.

Eep tentatively HOPS in.  Guy STEADIES her. Then shows 
her how to move her arms in a swimming motion.

Guy SUPPORTS Eep by holding one hand under her tummy.  
She begins to SWIM.

Gran and Ugga SMILE mischievously - a positive vibe is 
building.  

The Croods ALL JUMP at once.

Grug is left alone.  Belt uses Grugs arm as a diving 
platform.  Gran, Sandy and Belt are doing synchronized 
swimming. Then Grug sees Eep and Guy SURFACE -  Eep is on 
Guys shoulders!  This is too much for Grug!

                GRUG
       Augh!  No no no!  Not cool.  Not cool.  
       Not cool.

Grug DIVES IN to put a stop to any potential shenanigans. 

Grugs huge tidal wave SWAMPS Guy and Eep.  Grug SINKS to 
the bottom.

ON GRUG laying on the bottom.  His family SWIMS above him 
on the tails of Fishcats, confident and free and buoyant.

A lone bubble escapes Grugs nose, like oil oozing from a 
sunken wreck.  Hes feeling mighty extraneous.

Grug sees the Macawnivore swimming towards him.  Grug 
swims for his life.  Ends in a big splash.

PAN UP TO THE ENTRANCES TO THE MAZE



                GUY
       So the bear says, Your cave?  Ive been 
       dumping my bones here since last week.

                GRAN
       Last week, haha.  Thats a funny story!

                GUY
       Its not a story!  Its a joke.

                GRAN
       Whats a joke?

                GUY
       You know, just making something up... to 
       make you laugh.

                GRAN
       Hah, I dont get it.

CUT TO:

EXT. TUFA MAZE - AFTERNOON

The Croods stand motionless before an open plain, deeply 
sculpted with meandering grooves which form a massive 
MAZE.

Guy is handing out SHELLS to the Croods.

                GUY
       Here you go, one for you, and this ones 
       for you.  



                THUNK
       Thanks.

Grug is annoyed by everyone blowing their shells.

                GRUG
       Okay. Okay. Thats enough. I dont see 
       why the kids need their own shells.

                GUY
       So if anyone gets in trouble, we can call 
       the others.

                GRUG
       Wait-- youre saying we should split up?

                GUY
       We can try more paths at once.  Its the 
       fastest way through.


                GRUG
       Croods stick together.  

                GRUG 
       Your way isnt safe.

                GUY
       They can handle it.

                EEP
       We can do it, dad.

                GRUG
       No no no no no.  Its my job to keep you 
       safe.  Im still in charge and we are not 
       splitting up.
            (seeing Eep and Guy together)
       Except for you two.  And thats final.  

Grug SITS down like a silverback gorilla.

Just then, A HUGE RUMBLE.  The EARTH STARTS TO SHAKE 
VIOLENTLY. The Croods and Guy are KNOCKED DOWN into the 
Maze each falling into a separate entrance.

They disappear into the rift like a penny dropped down a 
drain.

As Grug and Guy slide passed each other. Frustrated Grug, 
tries to punch Guy.



                GUY
       Oh, hello.

INSIDE THE MAZE

The SHAKING COMES TO A STOP. Everyone (now separated) 
gathers themselves.

ON GRUG-- finding himself alone.

                GRUG
            (very frightened)
       Hello?  Is everyone alright? 

                UGGA
            (trying to calm him)
       Were okay, Grug.

                THUNK
       Dad?  Im freaking out a little bit.  
       Just tell me what to do. Just what do I 
       do right now?

                GRUG
       Stay where you are.  Ill find you.

                GUY
       No.  Too slow.  Everybody, keep moving 
       forward and well get out.



                THUNK
       Dad?

                GRUG
            (almost hyperventilating)
       Yeah.  Okay.

ON THUNK

Looking very frightened.

                GRUG  
       Remember never not be afraid.

                GUY 
       You can do this.  

                THUNK
       Its gonna be okay. Im gonna pass out.

Thunk PICKS UP his shell, and tentatively makes his way, 
alone, into his branch of the maze.

ON EEP (OR GUY?)-- in another part of the maze. She puts 
her hand on the giant wall to her LEFT.

PULL BACK and see that they are actually in parallel 
channels but with the huge wall between them.

ON Gran and Ugga - encountering carnivorous flowers.

ON Thunk - encountering a croco-pup.

ON Eep - finding a flower dropped on her path.

ON Grug - reaching a fork.

Ugga and Gran don flowery camouflage.

Thunk THROWS his shell at the Crocopup, MISSES.  To his 
surprise the Crocopup returns the shell.

Thunk plays fetch with this portly beast, which shows him 
the way through the maze.


Eep PICKS UP the flower, puts it in her hair, then finds 
a more flowers dropped on her path.  She playfully begins 
hunting for Guy. 

Guy and Belt are secretly  and playfully tossing flowers 
in Eeps path. 

Grug POPS out of a passageway - hes back where he began.  
He chooses another tunnel.

Ugga and Gran pass unharmed through the flower grove - 
the colors and smells are overpoweringly vibrant.

Eep surprises Guy and Belt in their hideaway as the two 
of them continue to throw flowers over the edge and onto 
Eeps path.

                EEP
       You dropped these.

Guy slips and falls onto a huge lilypad. He smiles up at 
Eep.

They share a moment before Eep shyly vanishes again.

Grug finds himself back at the entrance of the maze.  He 
grumbles and enters a different tunnel.

ON THE MAZE EXIT -

Guy appears at the exit and puts his hand up to the 
setting sun that kisses the top of the mountain. Guy is 
amazed that he and Eep are both doing the same thing. He 
is smitten. Guy goes over to Eep. 

Guy takes her hand.

                GUY
       Come with me.

Eep and Guy turn to each other, just as Thunk emerges and 
tosses a rock for the Croco-Pup to fetch.

                THUNK
       Here boy, catch!

A shell note signals Ugga, Gran and Sandys arrival.  
There is an obvious change in the ladies. 



                THUNK 
       Gran?

Ugga removes her hat to reveal her new look.


                EEP
       Mom?  
  
              BELT
       (approving)
       Raaah raaah.

A loud shell blast interrupts.  It is followed by two 
others.



                UGGA
       Grug?

Grug lets out another blow on his horn.

                UGGA 
       Ill go get him.

ON GRUG still stuck in the maze.  He holds his head in 
defeat, and TOSSES the shell down.

TRUCK-IN on Grug.

CUT TO:


PAN UP a giant redwood tree.  The Croods are gathered in 
a cozy crook of the tree. 

Belt mixes drinks while Gran relaxes in a hammock.  Thunk 
is playing with his new pet.

                THUNK
       Good boy. Whose my good boy? You need a 
       name, you want a name?  Im going to call 
       you - Douglas.  Look at him.  Can you do 
       tricks? Roll over.   Come on Douglas, 
       roll over. 

Douglas ROLLS OVER, right OFF the tree.

                THUNK 
       Good boy Douglas!

Belt POURS a drink for Gran. Sandy takes Gran her drink 
as she spins over to her on her starfish shoes.

                GRAN
       I was in love once.  He was a hunter, I 
       was a gatherer.  It was quite a scandal.  
       We fed each other berries.  We danced.  
                
	GRAN 
       Then my father smashed him with a rock 
       and traded me to your Grandfather.

                SANDY/THUNK/EEP
       Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

       Ha ha ha ha.

                BELT

PAN DOWN TO TREE BASE

Ugga and Grug approach.  They hear the LAUGHING coming 
from high above.  Grug peers up and sees the SWINGING 
HAMMOCKS, torch lights.  

                GRUG
            (panic)
       Croods!  Come get down here!  

                UGGA
       Grug, theyre okay.  Guys with them. 

                GRUG
       Oh, oh, Guy.  Guy is with them.  Well 
       thank you for bringing me that 
       interesting Guy update!

A BEAT - Ugga regards her husband 

                UGGA
       Oh, okay. Im gonna go up and why dont 
       you join us when you stop being a big 
       drag!

Ugga climbs up the tree to be with the rest of the 
family.

Grug isnt thrilled with Uggas shot at him. He picks up 
two rocks and tries to make fire.

                GRUG
       Sleep pile? How about a story, huh? 
       Anyone?

Grug listens intently.  All he hears is laughter.

TREE TOP

Thunk, Sandy Belt and Gran are sitting around a torch, 
listening to one of Grans stories.

                GRAN
       And then Torg said Know it? I drew it!


                THUNK GRAN SANDY BELT
       Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

                THUNK
       That makes no sense.  

Ugga arrives and sits next to Guy.  She takes in the 
scene.

                UGGA
            (to Guy)
       I know it was hard for you to bring us 
       along, but they had the best day of their 
       lives... Thank you for that.

A RUMBLE distracts Guy.  He looks to the horizon.  FIRES 
and SMOKE on the horizon mark the leading edge of the 
collapse.  Eep comes to his side.

                GUY
       I want to show you something.

Guy LIGHTS A TORCH and leads the Croods up, up, to the 
forest canopy.  

Guy BLOWS OUT his torch.  The night sky is revealed in 
all its glory.  The Croods are amazed.

Music POUNDS as the spectacle SWEEPS around the Croods.  
Perched on the canopy of the forest the Croods seem to 
sit at the very brink of the universe.

                THUNK
       More suns in the sky than you can count.

                GUY
       Every sun that crosses our sky, comes to 
       rest up there.



                EEP
       Tomorrow.
           
     GUY
       Thats where well be safe.

ON GRUG ARRIVING at the tree top.  When he sees the stars 
he DUCKS back down, terrified.  

He overhears the rest of the conversation.

Eep with tears in her eyes.

                EEP
       Im going with Guy.

Grug is beside himself with panic, sick at the thought of 
losing Eep.

                GRUG
            (whispered)
       No.  Not my little girl.

                EEP
       Come with us.

                UGGA
       I cant go without Grug. 

                GRAN
       Well, that makes one of us. Count me in!

                UGGA
       Really Mom? Now?

Grug continues to listen in.

                GRAN
       Grug has no idea how to protect us. In 
       fact, he has no ideas at all.

                UGGA
       No, thats not true.  What about that one 
       time when he a...

                GRAN
       Face it!  If he actually had an idea of 
       his own Id, Id have a heart attack and 
       die!

                THUNK
       Hey wait.  Lets ask that ugly lady if 
       shes seen dad.

       
                UGA
	Yeah.

Grug SPINS AROUND.  Hes wearing a rasta-style wig made 
from knotted grass.  The sight SHOCKS Ugga.

                GRUG
       Havent seen him.

 
                UGGA
      Augh!

ON GRUG with the family standing around him.

       What are you doing?

       Yeah, Wow. Like, I was up all night cuz
       like all these, ideas just kept coming to 
       me.  

Grug LIFTS his tunic, a Boa Constrictor is wrapped around 
his waist.

                GUY 
       Is that a snake?

                GRUG
       Belt! New and improved!  Its even self-
       tightening. Ow!

The constrictor SQUEEZES Grug till he turns blue.  Grug 
SMACKS it and it relaxes a little.

                UGGA
       What is that on your head?

                GRAN
       Its called desperation.

Grug strokes his weird, fake rasta-hair.

                GRUG
            (swings his long hair around)
       I call it a rug.  Rhymes with Grug.  
       And this one.  I call it a ride.  
       Rhymes with Grug.

Grug regards a boulder as if its a Ferrari.

                GUY
       That, doesnt--

                GRUG
       Its gonna get us places faster than 
       shoes.  

Grug climbs on top of the rock, facing the wrong way.

                GRUG 
       Yeah.  Try to keep up.

He LEANS FORWARD.  The car ROLLS downhill and SMASHES 
through a redwood, TOPPLING it.

                THUNK
       I wish I had a ride.

ON THUNK

His face SLATHERED with reddish mud.

                GRUG
       Painting is a thing of the past.  I call 
       this, a snap-shot.

Grug takes a huge flat stone and SMASHES it against 
Thunk, forcibly transferring the mud image to the rock.

Grug shows the Croods.

                THUNK
       Lets do it again. I think I blinked.

Thunk PASSES OUT.

ON THE CROODS

Wearing wooden sunglasses.  They are effectively wearing 
blindfolds.

                GRUG
       I call them shades.

                THUNK
       The sun doesnt hurt my eyes anymore!  
       Where do you get these great ideas?

                GRUG
       Since I dont have a brain, theyre 
       coming from my stomach.  Down deep below, 
       and then up again into my mind.    

Thunk walks into a tree. All the other Croods RAISE their 
shades in time to see Grug walk over a cliff.

                GUY
       Grug.  We have to keep moving.

ON GRUG 

                GRUG
       See, I got ideas, I got thoughts.

ON Grug lifting a huge flat rock over his head. 

                GRUG 
       Like this.  I call it a mobile home.  
       Isnt that something?

A huge BEAST BUNNY JUMPS into the opening of the rock.  
Grug is smashed flat.

ON GRUG

Standing on one side of a primitive Teeter-Totter.

                GRUG 
       And Im calling this one a lifterator.


                EEP
       Mom?

                UGGA
       I know.  Its bad.

Grug tosses a massive boulder on the opposite end.  Grug 
is LAUNCHED into the sky. Grug becomes a speck in the 
sky.  He is HIT by LIGHTNING.

                GRAN
       I almost feel sorry for him.

Grug falls back down onto the teeter totter dislodging 
the boulder from the other side. The boulder rolls back 
down onto Grug.

                GRAN 
       Hah, no I dont.

       What are you trying to do Grug?

ON GRUG

Burned and battered, laying in the bottom of a turtle 
shell boat.  

Ugga is attending to his injuries.  

                GRUG
       I thought if I could have ideas like Guy, 
       maybe Eep would listen to me.  Maybe she 
       wouldnt want to go with Guy.

Ugga gets a PAINED look on her face.

                UGGA
       Oh Grug, is that what this is all about?

Ugga is about to confess her thoughts of going to 
Tomorrow with Guy when Grug interrupts her.

                GRUG
       And I also thought it would kill your 
       mother. So you know? Win win.

                GUY
       Were here.

The view of the mountain is beautiful.

Thousands of birds fly overhead darkening the sky.

The shell boat hits the shore.  The Croods step out onto 
land.

An explosion goes off on a nearby mountain.  A PLUME of 
magma BURSTS from the water in the distance.

Grug looks around for shelter and spots a cave.

                GRUG
       Cave!  Everyone inside.  Come on!  Hurry 
       up, lets go.  Go, go.

The Croods dont want to move.


                EEP
       No.

                UGGA
            (gently)
       No more caves, Grug.



                GRUG
       What?

                GRAN
       Were gonna jump on the sun and ride it 
       to Tomorrow with Guy.

                GRUG
       Wait, so youre all going to do this?

Silence from the Croods answers his question.



                GRUG 
       Thunk?


                THUNK
       Sorry, dad.

Thunk joins the others.  Its the last straw.

                EEP
       You have to stop worrying for all of us.

                GRUG
       Its my job to worry.  Its my job to 
       follow the rules.

                EEP
       The rules dont work out here.

                GRUG
       They kept us alive.

                EEP
       That wasnt living, that was just, not 
       dying.  Theres a difference.

                GRUG
       Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me.

Ugga doesnt move.

                EEP
       We would be dead if we listened you.  

Grug is STUNNED.

                EEP 
       We have to follow Guy now.

Grug slowly turns around to face Guy.  He is smoldering.

       
                GRUG
	Guy?

                UGGA
       Guy, run.


Grug lunges toward Guy, SCREAMING.

                GRUG
       AAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!

Grug ATTACKS Guy - they fall down an embankment.

CUT TO:


Grug CHASES Guy across a TREMBLING landscape.

                GUY
       This is pointless.  Were running out of 
       time.  Everything is collapsing.  Youre 
       being irrational and counterproductive.

                GRUG
       Big words anger me.  Keep talking.

                GUY
       Countermeasures.

Belt THROWS fruit at Grug.  The fruit HITS Grug square in 
the face.  Hes blinded.  He doesnt stop.

                GUY 
       Remember how you were this morning?  You 
       changed, remember?  Idea man?  Modern 
       man?

Guy comes to a sudden stop - hes stepped in a small 
puddle of TAR.

Grug wipes his eyes clean of fruit.


                GRUG
       I... am... a... CAVEMAN.

                GUY
       No, no, no wait.

Guy and Grug do a slow-motion PLUNGE over a tar-fall.  As 
they descend Grug SWINGS at Guy, coating himself with 
tar.  Grugs arms are held like glue.  His punches stop 
well short of Guys face.  Guy and Grug arrive in a wide 
pool of tar.  They SINK slowly.

                GRUG
       Hnnnnnngh!  No.  What is this stuff that 
       saves you from my punches?

                GUY
            (hollow)
       Tar.

The tone of Guys voice  SINKS IN.  Grug CEASES his 
attack.

                GUY 
       Please Grug. You have to stop struggling. 

                GRUG
       No.  I have to get back to them.

     
                GUY
  Grug! Stop!

Grug looks to Guy.  

                GUY 
       No one gets out of this.  Believe me. I 
       know.

Grug gets it.

     
                GRUG
  Your...?

                GUY
       Family.  Yeah.

                GRUG
       Sorry.  


Grug looks at Guy again - he needs more than that.  Guy 
takes a deep breath - this is going to be hard.

                GUY
       I was little when it happened.  The last 
       thing my parents told me was, Dont 
       hide.  Live.  Follow the Sun.  Youll 
       make it to Tomorrow.

This resonates with Grug.

A thread of light trickles through the storm, falling 
just near enough to Guy he can gather it in his palm.

                GRUG
       You followed the light.  My daughter is a 
       lot like you.

                GUY
       No.  Shes like you.  She loves you but 
       always forgets to say it.  Just like you 
       forget to tell her.

Grug ponders this.  A CHANGE comes over Grug.  He focuses 
on Guy.  This hits Grug hard.  

                GRUG
            (crushed)
       I guess I was just busy keeping them all 
       alive.

Guy considers Grug.

                GUY
       Its okay. Thats what Dads do.

Grug smiles.  He regards Guy in a different light.  He 
sees him not as a boy but a man.  Someone good enough for 
his little girl.

                GRUG
       Thats right... but we cant do that from 
       here.  We need one of your ideas. 

The music TURNS.  

                GRUG 
       Come on. You can do it.

Buoyed by Grugs encouragement, Guy swings into action 
mode. 

                GUY
       Belt!  Emergency Idea Generator, 
       activate!

Belt hits Guy in the head with a rock.


                GUY 
       Ow!
            (then)
       Ive got it!

We are tracking with the MACAWNIVORE.  Suddenly, the big 
cat stops.  His eyebrows raise.

MACAWNIVORES POV - a FEMALE MACAWNIVORE PUPPET.  

CUT TO:

 
 
                BELT
      Ta-daaaaa

                GRUG
      Wow.

                GUY
       Yeah, I know.  But hes doing the best 
       with what he has. Lets go.

Grug and Guy are holding bones connected to the puppet.  
Belt SIGNALS to Guy.

                GUY 
       There he is. Belt, I want romance, drama, 
       sincerity.  Move me.

Belt makes music, which grabs the Macawnivores
attention.

                GUY 
       Okay he sees us!

Belt plays a little melodramatic tune.

Grug halfheartedly moves the bones hes holding. 

                GUY 
       Thats our cue.  Now work it!  

The puppet starts shaking its tail.  

                GUY 
       Hes not coming over.  I dont think our 
       puppet looks scared enough.

                GRUG
       Scared?  Ill show you scared.  Hand me 
       those acting sticks!

Grug shakes the puppet and makes a frightening sound of 
terror.  

Suddenly, the Macawnivore leaps forward and jumps on the 
puppet. He grabs it and pulls it up out of the tar, 
bringing Grug and Guy along with it.

Grug and Guy hang on to the bones of the puppet frame.

The Macawnivore shakes the puppet, pulling it out of the 
tar along with Grug and Guy. 



                GUY
       Hold on!

The puppet breaks apart, the Macawnivcore turns to Grug 
and Guy.  He is not pleased.

                BELT
       Da da daaaaaa...

The Macawnivore dashes towards the pair.  They try to run 
from him.  The Macawnivores paws slip slowly backwards 
into the nearby tar--hes stuck. The tar snaps him back 
and throws him far from Grug and Guy. 

Belt blows a whistle signalling a field goal!

                GRUG
       Yes. You did it!

Grug PATS Guy on the back. Grug realizes his hand is 
stuck to Guys back.

The Croods come running to help them.





                UGGA
       Grug.

                THUNK
       Dad!

Grug and Guy TURN to see the rest of the Croods. Grug 
waves to the family with Guy stuck to his hand.

                GUY
       Hey, were okay!

The family stops to take this in.

                GUY 
       Yeah, were okay.

The ground shakes violently.  Meteors stream across the 
sky.

                GUY 
       Grug. Your call.

Grug knows his answer.

                GRUG
       Take us to Tomorrow.

CUT TO:


EXT. EDGE OF THE WORLD - EARLY EVENING.

ON THE CROODS

RUSHING up the gun-sight into the bright rays of the sun.

                GUY
       Hurry!  Come on.  Were gonna make it!

When the Croods rush toward Tomorrow, it is a golden, 
ethereal image created by a perfect alignment of sun, 
clouds, and mountain.  From the Croods POV it looks as if 
they can cross a solid bridge of clouds and climb onto a 
waiting sun. 

                EEP
       You were right.  

                GUY
       There it is.  The sun.  We can do it! We 
       can ride it to Tomorrow.

Even Grug is taken with the sight - its there after all.

The Croods stare at the open meadow across from them.  
Tremors violently SHAKE the ground.


                GUY 
       Run!

When the rift OPENS in front of them, the hot gasses and 
blasts of hot ash BURST the clouds from beneath.  The 
debris shades the sun, revealing a very Earthly landscape 
beyond.

From the Croods perspective, Tomorrow vanished before 
their eyes.

A SHOCKWAVE knocks a large chunk of rock off the edge the 
Croods are standing on blowing them backwards.

                GUY 
       I dont understand. The sun was right 
       here.  It was right here.

KABOOM!  A gargantuan jet of ash STABS at the sky.  Ugga 
PULLS the Croods away from the ledge.  She herds them 
back toward the gunsight.

                UGGA
       We have to go back to the cave.  Hurry, 
       hurry, stay together.  Lets keep moving.  
       Move, move!  Everybody hold my hand.  
       Thunk lets go.  Go!  Lets stay 
       together.

But Grug doesnt join them.  Instead, Grug takes a step 
TOWARD the precipice, peering into the curtain of ash as 
if trying to burn a hole straight through it.

                UGGA 
       Grug?  Whats wrong with you?  Grug well 
       die if we stay here!  

Grug spies a wispy shaft of light STRUGGLING through the 
ash cloud.  He HOLDS UP his hand to feel it.  A beam of 
light settles on his palm.  Grug is ENLIGHTENED.

                UGGA 
            (softly to Grug)
       Grug.  Listen to me.  Weve gotta get 
       back to that cave.

Grug looks back at his family - huddled, terrified.  The 
picture of what he would have wanted in the beginning.  
The sight bothers him. 

Grug TURNS to face them.

                GRUG
       No more dark.  No more hiding.  No more 
       caves.

BEAT

BEAT

                GRUG 
       Whats the point of all this?

                GRUG 
       To follow the light.


A smile breaks across Eeps face - her dad has answered 
the question.

                GRUG 
       I cant change.  I dont have ideas.  But 
       I have my strength.  And right now thats 
       all you need.

                UGGA
       No.  We dont know whats over there.  
       Maybe nothing.  Its too risky.

                GRUG
       Its a chance.

Belt wipes a tear off his face.

                GUY
       Ill take that chance.

Grug LIFTS Guy above his head.

                GRUG
       You know, Ive wanted to throw you away 
       ever since I met you.

                GUY
       Heh.  Thats a joke, right?

                GRUG
       Whats a joke?

Grugs comment freaks Guy out.  ANOTHER ANGLE shows Grug 
with a twinkle in his eye. 

Belt puts on his helmet for safety.

With a titanic effort, he HURLS Guy in to the void.

The Croods wait an eternity.  Then - a HORN SOUNDS.

                UGGA
       He made it... He made it...

                GRUG
       Okay, Thunk.  Your turn.

                THUNK
       Youre not coming, are you?

                GRUG
       When you make it, so will I.

Grug HURLS Thunk.


Ugga KISSES Grug.  She whispers in his ear.  
                UGGA
       You did good.

                SANDY
       Daddy.

Grug wipes a tear from Uggas eye.  Then lifts her above 
his head.  He HURLS her across. 

                GRUG
       Gran.

Gran is next in line.

                GRAN
       No mush, just throw me.

Grug LIFTS her above his head.

                GRAN 
       Wait.  You surprised me today.  Lunkhead.

Grug SMILES and throws her next.

                GRAN 
            (landing on the other side)
       Still alive!!!

Another TREMBLER.  MORE cliff FALLS away.  Now the 
distance is even greater. 

Eep is next in line.



                GRUG
       Time to go.

	      EEP
       No.  I have too much to say to you.  I 
       need to fix everything and I dont have 
       time.

                GRUG
       I can fix it.

Grug embraces Eep.

                EEP
       This works good.  What do you call it?

                GRUG
       I was thinking of calling it a Hug.  
            (clears his throat)

                GRUG
      Because it rhymes with Grug.  But you can 
       change it if you want.

                EEP
       No.  I like a Hug.  

A BEAT.

                GRUG
       I love you.

Eep takes in the full effect of her dads words.


                EEP
       I...

The ground begins to shake and break apart around them.

                EEP 
       Dad, Im scared.

                GRUG
       Never be afraid.

The gap grows wider.  Grug lifts Eep and makes the 
greatest throw of his life.  

The tumult parts briefly.  Grug can see his entire family 
safe on the other side.  He waves a last goodbye.  To his 
surprise, a shaft of sunlight has settled on his open 
hand.

                GUY
       There. I see him!

The family waves to Grug to let him know they are okay.

CUT TO:


EXT. CLIFFSIDE

Grug is startled by another earthquake.  The ground is 
ripping itself apart as meteors begin to fall around him.  
Grug dodges falling debris and lighting and manages to 
crawl into a nearby cave-- a familiar place for him. 

INT. CAVE

Grug grabs two pieces of flint and starts clicking them 
together, just as Guy did earlier.  They ignite.  Grug 
has created his very first fire.

                GRUG
            (pleased)
       Hey, I did it.

Another earthquake shakes the cavern.  Grug moves over to 
a wall and uses some nearby mud to paint a portrait of 
his family.  He paints each member individually and then 
looks longingly at the family he will never see again.

The torch begins to go out.  Grug blows on it and is 
startled by the massive Macawnivore beast, growling at 
him.

                GRUG 
       Ahhhh!  Back!  Stay back!  Stay back!

The Macawnivore blows out the torch. Another meteor hits 
the cave with a loud boom! The Macawnivore stops growling 
and starts blowing on the torch along with Grug.  It is 
just as frightened as Grug.  Grug reaches out and pets 
the now gentle carnivorous beast.  

INT. CAVE

Grug and the Macawnivore huddle together in a prehistoric 
armistice.  When suddenly, Grug hears the dim tone of 
Eeps shell signal.  He rushes to the entrance to the 
cave.  He surveys the raging CATACLYSM outside the cave 
as the world is being torn asunder.

He hears the SHELL ALARM blow TWO MORE TIMES.  His family 
is in trouble.

                GRUG
       Theyre in trouble.  Hang on!  Im 
       coming.

The scale of his problem sinks in.

                GRUG 
       How do I get across?  Gotta think.  What 
       would Guy do?  What would Guy do?   

Something occurs to Grug.  


                GRUG 
       What would I do?  

He absent-mindedly hands the torch to the Macawnivore.

                GRUG 
       Hold this.



Grug CLOSES HIS EYES, and CONCENTRATES.

The ember of a thought FLICKERS TO LIFE in Grugs brain. 

                GRUG 
       I... have... an...                     IDEA!

                MACAWNIVORE
       Erm?

CUT TO:

EXT. FIELD

Grug uses a log to wipe tar all over a giant rib cage.  
Grug runs out of the cave and into a nearby field and 
startles a pack of nesting PIRANHA OWLS.  He turns back 
to the Macawnivore.  

The meat-eating birds begin to chase Grug.


                GRUG
       Run!  

Grug leaps onto the Macawnivores back as the birds move 
in closer.  The ground begins to break up violently as 
lakes empty themselves and entire forests turn sideways.

The Macawnivore rushes into a giant rib cage that Grug 
has coated with tar.  The Piranha Owls hit the rib cage 
and stick to it.  As they fight to free themselves, the 
rib cage lifts off the ground.  Grug takes a giant tree 
branch, ignites it, and uses it as a rudder, scaring the 
Piranha Owls and prompting them to fly in one coherent 
direction.



                GRUG 
       Yes!

As the cage flies, above the fiery landscape, Grug sees 
Douglas, sitting forlornly with the shell still in his 
mouth.  


                GRUG 
       Douglas?

Grug doesnt even debate it, he runs back for the little 
monstrosity.

                GRUG 
       Hey, I know that guy.

Grug JUMPS out of the cage and rushes over to grab the 
gerbils.  Then Grug notices a familiar Liyote hiding 
under a nearby rock.  He GRABS the Liyote. Grug sees the 
TRIP-GERBILS stranded as well. Grug TWIRLS the Trip-
Gerbils around his neck like a scarf.  


                GRUG 
       Get up!

A ROAR BUILDS behind Grug - the pyroclastic flow is 
SPEEDING closer.  

Grug CATCHES UP to the lumbering blimp-cage.  He PUSHES 
it to go faster.



                GRUG 
       Hold on.

The pyroclastic cloud BLASTS up the narrow passage.  
Finally, with Grugs strength, the cage CLEARS the edge 
of the cliff.  

The CLOUD HITS them all, SWALLOWING the Cage like a 
speck.

CUT TO:

EXT. TOMORROW

ON EEP

Standing at the edge of the cliff alone, BLOWING her 
shell horn.  Behind her, Sandy HOWLS.  Gran puts a 
comforting arm around her grandchildren, even she has a 
tear in her eye.

The ground begins to shake softly.

                GUY
       Its not safe here.


                GRAN
       Ill tell her.

Gran walks up to Eep. Eep continues to blow her shell 
horn. Eep and Gran share a moment. Eep breaks into tears.  
Gran looks at her shell horn and BLOWS it loudly. Eep is 
happily surprised.

The whole family, even Guy, steps up next to Eep and 
begins BLOWING their shell horns.

Its clear from Eeps expression she has no intention of 
budging.

                EEP
       I never got to tell him.

Ugga appeals to Eep.

                UGGA
       Eep, if your Dad were here, he would tell 
       you to--

                GRUG 
       GET OUT OF THE WAY!!!

                THUNK
       Wow, you sound just like him.

Ugga looks up.  Guy LOOKS UP. Everyone looks up!

                GRUG 
       GET OUT OF THE WAY!!!

                SANDY
       Daddy!

                EEP
       He did it!
                GUY
       Hes riding the Sun... but not very well. 
       Everybody out of the way!

Grug CRASHES near the family.  They run to meet him.
	
		THUNK
       Dad!
	
		UGGA
       Grug!


                GRUG
       Ahhh!  Wheres the danger? Who blew their 
       shell?

But all Grug sees is his astonished family staring back 
at him.

Eep RUNS to him, HUGS him ferociously, nearly knocking 
him down.

                EEP
       I love you too.

The rest of the Croods begin running to Grug. Grug hugs 
each of them like never before.

                GRUG
       One, two, three, four, five, six... 

Grug puts his arm around Guy.

                GRUG 
       ... and seven.

Belt wants to be acknowledged as well.


                BELT
       Eerrghh.

                GRUG
	And a half.

All the animals join in hugging Grug.

                GRUG 
       And eight, and nine. 

Douglas runs up and licks Thunk.

                THUNK
       Douglas!  Dad you saved him!

                GRUG
       Well, a boys gotta have a pet.

Suddenly the group rises up as the Macawnivore stands 
near them.

                GRUG 
       Turns out, Im a cat person.

Grug notices a TAIL sticking out of Chunkys mouth.

                GRUG 
       Uh!  No.

Chunky SPITS OUT the TRIP-GERBILS.  He GRINS sheepishly. 
The TRIP-GERBILS run to Gran knocking her over in their 
excitement.

                EEP
       You really need to see this.

The whole family takes this amazing view in then looks to 
Grug for his decision.

                GRUG
       We should go there.  

DISSOLVE TO:

SEQ. 3500 - EPILOGUE

RUSHING TOWARD A SHORELINE covered in dense palms, gentle 
waves lapping at the sand.

On Eep, fixing her hair. We PULL OUT to see the whole 
family preparing for a family photo. 

                EEP 
       This is me.  My names Eep.  And this, is 
       my family.  The Croods.  If you werent 
       clued in by the sun tans and pets, were 
       not exactly cavemen anymore.  

Grug has a wonderful picture making contraption they are 
about to experience. The slab of rock smacks them all in 
the face leaving the first family photo.

                THUNK
       Lets do that again. I think I blinked.

BACK TO THE SHORELINE, RUSHING ever closer to the beach.

                EEP 
       Our world is still plenty harsh and 
       hostile.  But now we know the Croods will 
       make it.

ON BELT riding on the back of the Crocopup, delivering a 
drink to Gran, PULL OUT to reveal she is in a sled, 
hitched to a team of Liyotes. The liyotes are tending to 
her. Gran sips her drink. 

                EEP
       Because we changed the rules.  The ones 
       that kept us in the dark.   

On Ugga sharpening a spear. The Macawnivore comes in to 
frame with Grug riding on top. Ugga tosses him the spear. 
Eep, flips from out of the trees. She blows her horn to 
call Guy and the BearOwl for a ride. 

                EEP 
       And because of my dad, who taught us that 
       anyone can change... 

The Macawnivore LEAPS through the trees onto a broad, 
beautiful beach with Grug and Ugga atop.

                GRUG
       Release the baby!

                EEP
       Well, sort of.    

Thunk breaks through the trees riding a LANDWHALE. Sandy 
and Belt are riding the Crocopup. Eep and Guy are riding 
the BearOwl.

                EEP 
       So from now on well stay out here.

The first camera picks them up as it reaches the beach.  
It FOLLOWS the Croods as they TURN and ride toward a 
sunrise.

                EEP 
       Where we can follow the light.

FLARE TO WHITE  

BEAT

Belt and Sandy poke their heads up at the base of the 
screen.

                BELT/SANDY
       Da da daaaaaaaaaaa.
