TITLES

Abstract images begin to form.  They move beneath the
titles, brilliant against the darkness, the ghost-like
apparitions fighting a current as if caught in the
whirlwind of time.

Our IMAGE SHARPENS.  The apparitions are no longer there.
Instead, police tape comes INTO FOCUS, the seemingly
miles of it entangled on stacks of derelict cars that
fill the void.  The tape dances before us, undulating to
a macabre rhythm, floating on the nocturnal winds.  We
PAN.

An auto wrecking yard at midnight.  Empty, yet occupied.

Light slowly INVADES the FRAME, filling in the wrecking
yard's cavernous shadows.  A distant ROAR announces
itself above the SOUNDTRACK, the earth POUNDING CLAMOR
AMPLIFYING in with every second.

As if searching for its source, CAMERA PIVOTS AROUND.
Instantly, we find ourselves caught in the glare of
headlights, and we've just enough time to make out the
semi truck before it plows through the yard's chain link
gate, shattering it like so much glass, the truck heading
directly AT CAMERA, running it over as if it weren't
there.

EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

BOOMING UP and OVER the fence, the yard is a veritable
maze of old, rusted cars, piled up helter skelter, frozen
in time.  Broken glass, mangled engine parts, garbage and
litter... along with hundreds of spent shell casings, are
scattered in the dirt.

A caravan of UTILITY VEHICLES ROARS in behind the semi,
the convoy making a bead for the center of the yard.

Picking up the rear is a black Rolls-Royce Phantom II.

As they turn the last corner, the first thing we see are
"unearthly" flares.  Dozens of them, bright as hell,
lighting up the middle of the graveyard.

The CARS come SKIDDING to a stop.  Dust swirls.

The rear door opens, and CYRUS KRITICOS, 50s, wealthy,
immaculately dressed, not a hair out of place, steps out.
His hand rests on a shiny, silver-headed cane.  He
surveys the flares, shakes his head.

                 CYRUS
       Their little crusade is wearing
       thin.

                 RAFKIN (O.S.)
       I'll give them this... they are
       consistent.

Stepping out next is DENNIS RAFKIN, 20s, unshaven,
jittery.  He holds his head in his hands, massaging his
temples, obviously in pain.

(NOTE:  Whenever we cut to Rafkin we hear/sense a
piercing tone, underscoring the psychic waves he's
receiving.)

Cyrus produces a thin, brown designer cigarette from a
silver case.  Taps it as he speaks.

                 CYRUS

       As cancer...
            (lights his cigarette)
       Never bet against human nature,
       Dennis.  You'll always lose.

Behind him, Rafkin suddenly lurches forward, racked by
spasms.  Cyrus turns, with slight concern --

                 CYRUS
       Is it bad tonight?

                 RAFKIN
            (coughing, shaking)
       Bad is one way of describing it,
       but somehow...
            (wiping his sweaty
             forehead)
       ... insane seems more appropriate.

Rafkin doubles over in pain.  Dry heaves.

                 RAFKIN
            (recovering)
       It's my professional opinion that
       we get the hell out of here.  Now.

Two of Cyrus's team, dressed in assault gear, make their
way over.

                 CYRUS
            (ignoring Rafkin,
             re:  flares)
       Noted.  Clean this place up, and
       locate our guests.

Cyrus snaps his fingers.  An ASSISTANT steps forward
with a large photo.

When Cyrus turns around, he catches Rafkin gulping down
prescription drugs.  Cyrus strikes the bottle out of
Rafkin's hand with his cane.  Pink medicine runs down
Rafkin's face as he turns with rage.

                 RAFKIN
       Come on, Cyrus, I gotta take the
       edge off.

                 CYRUS
       You know the routine.  First
       things first.  Now where is he?

Cyrus holds it in the limo headlights; an aerial photo
of the graveyard.  Rafkin, closing his eyes, reaches
out towards the photo with one hand, then touches the
earth with the other.  A silent moment.

       Where?

                 CYRUS

Then a huge spark arcs between the psychic and the
ground.  Rafkin jolts back, as if shocked.

                 RAFKIN
       Sweet Jesus, Cyrus, there's got to
       be over forty victims here!  I
       thought you said this guy killed
       twenty people.

                 CYRUS
       Twenty when he was alive.  He's
       added a few more since then.
       Now where's the Breaker, Dennis?

Rafkin ignores the photo, and points at a spot deep
inside the auto graveyard.  Cyrus grabs a headset from
the Assistant.

                 CYRUS
            (into microphone)
       All teams go to alpha.  I
       repeat!--

EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Teams of men pile out of the vehicles.  The back of the
semi is opened, revealing racks of remote-operated
amplifiers.

Others unload inch-thick, eight-foot-square sheets of
glass, rimmed with aluminum pipe, and inscribed with
ancient text.

The glass sheets are assembled to form a large cube.

Arrays of flood lamps illuminate the canyons of the
wrecking yard in stark white.

One side of the cube remains open... allowing entry
and -- ready to come down in theory, and close the
improvised "mousetrap."

Rafkin walks up behind Cyrus, still massaging his
temples.

                 RAFKIN
       Where'd he get a name like the Breaker
       anyway?  He a truck driver?

                 CYRUS
       It's simply folklore at work.
       The local color exorcising its
       demons...

Just then, a hideous HOWL ECHOES through the night --
part human, part God-knows-what.  Everyone stops.

Rafkin swallows hard.  Tosses away the empty prescription
drugs bottle, then opens an extra-large jar of aspirin,
pops a few into his mouth, crunches them like mints.

                 CYRUS
       ... or maybe it's because he broke
       his victims into as many pieces as
       possible.
            (exhaling smoke)
       Who's to say...?

       Cute...

                 RAFKIN

A shrill cacophony of METAL AND GLASS erupts from the
maze of the graveyard.  A large, dense object flies out
of the darkness and crashes down in front of them in a
cloud of dust.

It's a crushed car.  Cyrus sighs...

                 CYRUS
       I hate being rushed.

                 RAFKIN
       Cyrus, this one ain't like the
       others...
            (off the teams)
       Do they know what we're up
       against?

                 CYRUS
       These men are well paid.  That's
       all they need to know.

                 RAFKIN
       But this is suicide...

                 CYRUS
       Then I'll match their price... and
       yours.

                 RAFKIN
       You don't have that kind of money.

                 CYRUS
       You'd be surprised... now get to
       work.

This takes Rafkin by surprise.  He turns, taking a step
towards Cyrus.  Cyrus backs up, his cane instantly at
Rafkin's chest, keeping him distant.  Rafkin becomes
suspicious.

                 RAFKIN
       What are you hiding, old man?

                 CYRUS
       Careful, Dennis, curiosity killed
       the cat.

                 DAMON (O.S.)
       Son-of-a-bitch!

They both turn to see four team members dragging an
attractive man and woman, DAMON QUINTEROS and KALINA
ORETZIA, over to Cyrus.  Damon's a handsome chap with
a righteous fire in his eyes.  Kalina, his lover, is
equally fiery, late 20s, tough and sexy.  She cradles
in her arms an ancient book.

                 DAMON
       How can you possibly justify what
       you're doing, Cyrus?  It's out and
       out slavery.

                 RAFKIN
       Aw, jeezus, here we go again.

                 CYRUS
       Damon Quinteros and Kalina Oretzia.
       Every time I hunt must I scrape
       you off the bottom of my shoes?

                 KALINA
       These aren't animals you're
       trapping!  They're human beings!

                 CYRUS
       Why don't you guys go join
       Greenpeace or throw blood on the
       old ladies' fur coats, for Christ's
       sake... we have business.

                 KALINA
            (to Cyrus)
       Bastard!  Who are you to play
       God?!

                 CYRUS
       Playing's for children.  I'm
       going to be God.

                 DAMON
       You'll never pull it off!  Not
       without the right spells.  That
       and the thirteenth ghost!

Rafkin turns, alarmed.

       Thirteenth?

                 RAFKIN

                 CYRUS
       Get them out of my sight.  We've
       wasted enough time as it is.

The team straps Damon and Kalina to some car wreckage.

                 ASSISTANT (V.O.)
            (on headphones)
       All teams in position, Mr.
       Kriticos.

                 CYRUS
       Excellent... set up the transmitters.

Cyrus turns away from them as he slips on a pair of
ghost glasses.  The rest of the team around the
graveyard do so as well.

       Wait a minute!  The Breaker's number

       Yes, and then one more.  I

Nearby, a silver tanker rolls into the canyon of cars.

EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

A TEAM MEMBER opens the truck's valve:  Huge streams
of blood gush out from both sides, via two nozzles,
flooding the area around the cube.  Rafkin's jaw drops.

ON Cyrus, smiling.

                 CYRUS
       Power up the cube!

Somewhere a switch is thrown and the cube lights up.  The
symbols etched on its surfaces glow a brilliant green.

We BOOM OUT the door TO the antenna, and hear a HIGH-
FREQUENCY WHINE, mixed with the sound of repetitive
CHANTING.  Spells being read, over and over in Latin.

EXT. CENTER OF AUTO GRAVEYARD

Deep inside, at the sound of the CHANTING, there comes
another ungodly HOWL, angrier than before.

Along the perimeter, placing the amplifiers, shock
instantly registers with the teams when they realize the
transmission has begun, leaving them exposed.

We hear a CRASH of METAL and, on the headset, a confusion
of SCREAMS.

WITH RAFKIN

The screams of the men fill the air.

                 RAFKIN
       Christ, Cyrus... what have you
       done?

Off to the side, Damon and Kalina strain against the
ropes.

                 DAMON
       Dennis, listen!  He's not telling
       you the whole story!  His spells
       won't work with this one.  They're
       not strong enough.  Trust me on
       this... I know... Trust me.

                 KALINA
       Listen to him, Dennis.  He knows
       what he's talking about.

       Sorry, guys... I'm just here for
       the paycheck.

EXT. ANOTHER PART OF AUTO GRAVEYARD

We see another team race down an alley.  They turn a
corner.  One of them slips on something wet.  He gets
up, realizes he's slipped in the unravelled remains of
one of Team Two.

       Oh, shit...

                 TEAM MEMBER

sees his friend yanked up a wall of cars, then into the
wreckage.

An explosion of blood spatters from inside the broken
windshield.  A hand struggles against the glass.  A

12

EXT. ACROSS FROM PILE OF CARS - CONTINUOUS ACTION

12

As HIDEOUS SCREAMS fill the air, the Team Member turns
and starts climbing the other side.  Rafkin rounds a
turn, sees the Team Member climbing up the wall of cars.
The Team Member looks back as they approach.

                 TEAM MEMBER #3
       Run!  It's right behind me --

Suddenly, a SQUEAL of METAL as something invisible
reaches through the grill of the car and grabs the Team
Member by the waist.  He screams as he is folded over,
backwards, and yanked into the grill of the car.

Rafkin rushes toward him.

We hear BONES BREAK as the Team Member screams.

The Breaker, unseen on the far side of the heap of cars,
yanks on his victim, over and over, smashing the Team
Member's chin against the grill, trying to pull him
through.

Rafkin does the best he can to pull the man free, but it
seems hopeless.  The man screams and screams.

Abruptly, Rafkin's efforts seem, at last, to work.  With
a mighty tug, he tumbles back and falls to the ground.
Looks down and sees that he holds only the man's foot.

The wall of cars begins to move before Rafkin.  He leaps
just as the wall comes crashing down.

Rafkin scrambles and runs full bore back the way he came.
He looks back, speaks into his mike:

                 RAFKIN
       Cyrus, the spells aren't working!
       He's tearing this place apart!

EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD - WITH RAFKIN

Rafkin turns a corner and runs past two team members
heading in the opposite direction.

                 RAFKIN
       Hey, goddamnit, you're running
       the wrong way!

They don't slow down.

                 RAFKIN
            (to himself)
       Amateurs...

Rafkin turns a corner and realizes why the team members
were running this way.  A car at the end of this alley is
tipped up on its bumper, its undercarriage facing them,
and is moving toward them, fast.

Rafkin and another team member, deeper in the alley, hear
the HOWL of the Breaker behind the floating car.

                 RAFKIN
       Jesus H. Christ!  Run!!

Rafkin runs, but the team member doesn't, stunned by the
sight, remains frozen.  Suddenly the car stops -- and
lifts straight up into the air over him.

TEAM MEMBER'S POV - THROUGH GHOST VISION GLASSES

The Breaker comes INTO CLEAR VIEW for a fraction of a
second.  He's huge, seven feet tall, acromegalic, the
bones beneath the skin swollen and distorted.

He stares with burning eyes above a huge distended jaw.
He wears, prosaically, a filthy tattered garage uniform,
his name stitched above the pocket.  His face, chest
and arms are pockmarked with bullet holes dating from
his untimely death.

He takes the car that he holds overhead and slams it
down.  The team member dodges out of the way, but the
Breaker picks up the car again and slams it down again,
squashing him.  And then, again.  And then, for good
measure, once again.

14

EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD - WITH RAFKIN

14

Rafkin tears down the alleyway.  He turns a corner just
as the wall behind him collapses.

He's looking down a passage filled with team members,
with the cube serving as its plug:  a dead end.  It seems
the Breaker has everyone trapped, instead of vice versa.

Everyone runs toward the cube, splashing through pools of
blood.

BREAKER'S POV

The team members and Rafkin scatter before us.

Men climb up the walls of wreckage as the invisible
Breaker plows through, sending men flying high into the
air.  Rafkin slams hard against the wall, drops to the
ground.

15

EXT. GLASS CUBE

15

A team member runs, looks over his shoulder at the
pursuing Breaker.  He doesn't see where he's going and
runs straight against a blood-splashed glass wall.

He's blundered into the glass cube.  In an instant, the
Breaker's inside with him.

His entry trips an unseen switch.  The final glass wall
slides down, sealing the cube.  As it does, the howling,
and the team member's screams, drop to silence.

Inside the cube, something awful happens, but we can't
see through the smears of blood.

Rafkin regains his senses, scrambles towards the cube.

Inside the cube, the Breaker turns, realizes he's been
trapped, launches himself at the bloody sheet of glass,
presses his face to it, howls.

Rafkin recoils as the Breaker pounds at the glass.  With
each ghostly blow, the symbol glows red, but the
glass seems to have the power to contain the force:  it
holds.

                 RAFKIN
       Oh, that piss you off, does it?
       You know what pisses me off?  A
       dead guy throwing Buicks at me!

Rafkin eyes the horror, then tugs off his glasses.  The
Breaker disappears.

Rafkin collapses in exhaustion.

                 RAFKIN
            (into microphone)
       I gotta hand it to you, Cyrus, the
       bait worked.  You got your dozen
       now.  Happy?
            (beat)

       Cyrus?

                 KALINA (O.S.)
            (screaming, desperate)
       Help!  Somebody, please!  Oh God!

EXT. AUTO GRAVEYARD - TANKER - MOMENTS LATER

Rafkin rounds a pile of cars, and sees...

Kalina, on the ground, holding a dying Damon in her arms.
His throat has been slit, and Kalina holds her hand over
the gash, trying to keep him from dying.

But it's no use... he dies.  Kalina sobs.  Rafkin's in
awe, perhaps ashamed.

Rafkin turns nervously away.  And there, he sees Cyrus's
Assistant lying, dead, bloody and broken.  And beyond him,
lies Cyrus himself.

Cyrus's neck has been pierced by a long, metal shard.  His
eyes stare, cold and dead.  Rafkin brings his hands to
his head, distraught, almost weepy.

       Cyrus... oh, man... look at you...
       There goes my bonus.

Suddenly, someone grabs his arm, and spins him around.
It's Kalina.  She's sobbing and shaking Cyrus's glasses
in Rafkin's face.

                 KALINA
       Was it worth it?  Huh?  Playing
       God!  Was it...?

OFF Rafkin's shell-shocked look, we PAN OVER to see the
ghost of one of the techs, ripped apart and bloody,
studying the scene.

                                DISSOLVE TO:

INT. LARGE BEDROOM - MORNING 

17

A bright, sunny day...

THROUGH a glass window we see and hear two children out
playing in the yard.  A Norman Rockwell, picture-perfect
setting...

A young boy and a teenage girl romp in the grass, then up
to the window steps a beautiful woman, fresh from the
garden.  It's obvious she's the mother of these two.
Over the giggling of the kids she smiles at ARTHUR
KRITICOS, 50, sitting inside his bedroom, in a very
comfortable chair, taking in his family with pride.

We PAN TO Arthur as he smiles, content...

A sharp KNOCK on the bedroom door breaks the mood, and
Arthur turns.  Our UNCUT CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN TO the
door.  As it does, it SWEEPS ACROSS a desk decorated with
family photos, one of which is the woman at the window.

CAMERA CONTINUES TO the door, where we notice the wall
and door around KATHY, Arthur's 21-year-old daughter, has
somehow aged from the pristine room we thought we were
in.  Kathy sticks her head in.  Pretty if she ever had
time to fix her hair, clad in a University of Calumny
sweatshirt.  She stirs a pan of burnt scrambled eggs.

                 KATHY
       Dad... it's almost eight-thirty...
       shake a leg.  You'll miss your
       first class.  And could you tell
       Maggie to get the hell out of the
       bathroom.  She had her five
       minutes twenty minutes ago.

The door slams shut again.  Our UNCUT CAMERA CONTINUES TO
PAN AROUND the room.  As it does, the walls begin to age
drastically, pictures disappearing, books vanishing from
their shelves.  The room, and all its promise, simply slips
away.  By the time we GET TO the bed, we notice only one
side is occupied.  The other lies fallow.

Our UNCUT CAMERA RETURNS TO Arthur, who sits, unshaven,
in a decrepit chair, staring out at the brick wall lying
just outside the window, not ten feet from him.  Gone is
the world he knew, the beauty of a home, the sounds of a
family laughing in the summertime heat.  They are
replaced by the angry cacophony of the inner city
streets, its claustrophobic conditions, its hopeless
yoke.

Our CAMERA CONTINUES PAST Arthur, RETURNING TO the desk.
All are gone save one; the picture of his wife, which
sits charred and frameless, propped up against a stack of
bills.

INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

18

Arthur comes out of the bathroom and beholds, in the
kitchenette of his small, cramped three-bedroom
apartment...

A blur of activity:  Kathy cooks at the stove, his son
BOBBY, 7, eats a bowl of cereal at the kitchen table,
while scanning the obituary section of the newspaper.  He
records the different, humorous deaths with a microphone
and a tape recorder.

In the b.g., on the TELEVISION, a black and white horror
movie drones on (the original Thirteen Ghosts).

The nanny, MAGGIE, 26, just gets in the way... wiping the
counter, pouring the OJ, setting the table.  It's a very
disorganized way of doing things.

She's trying, sort of, but we can see from Kathy's body
language that she's at her wits' end with the woman.

                 BOBBY
       Today on 'Death in Manhattan This
       Morning,' we notice a small leap
       in heart attacks in the city,
       cancer deaths are down.  And we
       have a special treat for
       everyone!-- a body was found this
       morning decapitulated,
       decapilated, de--

Maggie cracks up.  Kathy turns toward him, nonplussed.

                 KATHY
       Bobby.  Find a healthier hobby.

Bobby shuts off the tape recorder, angry at the
interruption.

                 BOBBY
       Kathy, I'm broadcasting!

Arthur enters, chipper.

                 ARTHUR
       'Morning, everyone!

                 BOBBY
       Dad, they found a guy without a
       head in a dumpster behind Dunkin'
       Donuts.

       That's nice.

                 ARTHUR

Maggie ruffles Bobby's hair.  Arthur pours himself a cup
of coffee, sidles up to Kathy.

                 ARTHUR
            (sotto voce)
       Kathy, why don't you let Maggie
       make breakfast?  That's why I
       hired her.

                 KATHY
            (also sotto)
       Have you tasted her cooking?

Kathy makes a gagging response while scooping eggs onto
the first of three places on the counter.  He looks at
the eggs burned in effigy but continues smiling.

                 BOBBY
       Dad, will you tell Kathy that
       keeping a record of deaths is
       healthy because it's in the
       interest of science?

                 ARTHUR
       Kathy, it's healthy.

                 BOBBY
       She's being a real slut about it.

       Thank you, Maggie.

                 MAGGIE
       A term like 'bitch' would be more
       appropriate.  'Slut' is a term
       reserved for those of loose sexual
       morals, something, to be perfectly
       frank, Kathy could use a bit more
       of.

       Ha.  Ha.

                 KATHY

                 MAGGIE
       Well, it's true, girl.  When's the
       last time you had a date?

Arthur pretends to not be disturbed by the conversation
around him, smiling and nodding.

                 KATHY
       Why are you smiling?

                 ARTHUR
       I'm pretending you're all
       perfectly normal.  It's working
       pretty well, too...

Arthur turns toward the table, and holding a plate of
food and his coffee...

                 ARTHUR
       Hey, Edgar Allan Poe, you finish
       your homework?  Mr. Petersen tells
       me you aren't --

... trips on Bobby's scooter.  The hot coffee spills all
over him.  He falls back into the counter, knocking the
pan of eggs to the floor.

                 ARTHUR
       Jesus Christ, that's the third
       time I tripped on that thing,
       Bobby.  Get it off the floor
       before it kills someone.

       Sorry.

       Well, we don't have a bigger
       place, so let's just keep our
       stuff off the floor.  Alright?

Arthur wipes off his pants, but it's just one big stain.
Suddenly, there's a BUZZ at the DOOR.  Everyone goes
silent... Kathy looks to Arthur, who checks his watch.

                 ARTHUR
       Shit... I forgot, the lawyer.

                 KATHY

       What lawyer?

       I thought our credit was all cleaned
       up?

                 ARTHUR
       No, no.  It's not that.

Arthur goes to the door, mopping his crotch.

Arthur shakes his hand.  Ben can't help but notice the
stain in Arthur's trousers.

       Kriticos.

       I didn't know you have an Uncle
       Cyrus.

                 ARTHUR
       Had.  I met him a couple of times
       as a kid.  My dad always disliked
       him.  Said he squandered the
       family fortune.

                 KATHY
       We have a family fortune?

                 ARTHUR
       Well, no.  Cyrus squandered it.
       Didn't I just say that?

                 MAGGIE

       What's he late for?

       His next birthday.

                 BOBBY
            (the penny drops)
       You mean he's dead?

                 KATHY
       Now we get his attention.

                 BEN
       This message was recorded by Cyrus
       six months ago.  He asked that it
       be played for you in the event of
       his death...

Ben inserts a DVD into the laptop.  Cyrus's image appears

            (on computer)
       Sadly, if you're watching me now,
       that means I am no longer among
       the living.  Happily, that makes
       you and your family my sole
       beneficiaries.

The family members look at one another with anticipation.

deceased individuals, articles underneath each picture
describing their deaths.  It's a gruesome, graphic,
reportage of things we'd rather not think about.

The first is a suicide victim, found with her wrists
slashed in her bathtub.  Another's an archery accident
involving  a  little  boy.    The  list  goes  on  and  on,
ending with a serial killer, one Frank Mahoney, a.k.a.
the Breaker.

CONTINUE PANNING past books on the Occult, and Damon's

We LAND ON Kalina herself, stuffing her worn satchel.  A
lamp illuminates an ancient book in front of her with

                 ARTHUR
       Baby.  Bobby and I will manage.
       Besides, things look like they
       just got a little better.

                 KATHY
       Yeah, but that's not the point.
       It's just that... every smile you

       It's... not real, Dad.

Arthur's affected by her words.

       later you've got to stop blaming
       yourself.

EXT. HOUSE

An enormous and majestic house made of glass nestled
amongst pine trees.  Stark against the evening sky, the
house is awe-inspiring.

Even for an English teacher, Arthur has a hard time
finding the words.

There's also a Power & Light truck parked in front.

EXT. HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

23

The group approaches the front door.  It looks unusual,
yes, but it's also an undeniable architectural marvel.

                 BEN
       That's strange.

A young man appears, waiting in the solitary light of the
porch, a clipboard in his hand and a tool belt slung over
his shoulder.  He's dressed in a Power & Light uniform,
and ON CLOSER INSPECTION we see that it's Rafkin, in
disguise.  He approaches the family.

                 RAFKIN
       'Bout time someone got here.  You
       the owners?

       Who're you?

                 BEN

                 RAFKIN
       The power guy.  I don't know if
       you're aware of it, but this place
       keeps knocking out the power in the
       tri-quad area.  So if you don't
       mind, I need to check the breakers
       inside.

       Well, I could -- I mean, I could
       -- but, man, they frown upon
       that sort of thing, my bosses.

                 BEN
       That's not our problem --

                 RAFKIN
       Look, I've only been doing this job
       for, like, three weeks.  If you
       could find it in your hearts --

       Sure.

                 ARTHUR

Ben turns to Arthur.  After all, it is Arthur's house
now.

       Thanks...

                 RAFKIN

                 ARTHUR
       Arthur, Arthur Kriticos.

Rafkin hides his reaction.

                 RAFKIN
       Quite a place you got here.

                 KATHY
       Yeah... we're movin' in.

                 ARTHUR
       One step at a time...

24

EXT. HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - MOMENTS LATER

24

Outside the main structure is an entryway, with an inner
and outer door, almost like an airlock.  Arthur produces
the odd key and slips it into the keyhole.  The locking
mechanism, visible within the glass, beckons.

Arthur turns the key.  As it turns, we hear the MECHANISM
CLICK and WHIR.  Then, oddly, the key is sucked into the
keyhole, and vanishes.

Everyone looks at the now-empty keyhole, then at each
other, then back at the keyhole.

                 ARTHUR
       Must've, um, slipped into the

       looked at.

                 RAFKIN
       That didn't look like it slipped
       to me.  I got a cousin who could
       fix that --

                 BOBBY
       Dad, you broke it!

                 ARTHUR
       Bobby, go to a station break,

       Huh?

                 BOBBY

                 ARTHUR
       Give it a rest.

Bobby reluctantly clicks off the recorder.

INT. CLOCKWORK ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

In the basement of the house, in a dark space we see a
tiny pendulum within a delicate, antique set of gears
come to life.  AS we PULL AWAY, runes of odd description
come INTO VIEW, etched on ivory plates, the plates
attached to levers and meters standing poised, waiting...

The lights in the room suddenly flicker on.

We PULL AWAY FROM the odd bits of machinery, seeing it
for what it is:  a control panel of some kind.  Our
RETREATING CAMERA then becomes engulfed by what looks to
be a huge set of gears, made of brass and steel, standing
by.  We PULL OUT the other side of the gears, viewing the
machinery's massive size, the gears works nearly fifteen
feet high, dominating a room filled with pulleys and
steel cable.

Lights flicker on from within the house, allowing us to
see inside.  The most striking thing about it is that the
house is entirely transparent.  Even the interior walls
are made of glass, putting the furniture, fixtures and
all the expensive-looking antique decorations on stark
display.  Everyone stares at the alarming edifice,
fascinated.

       How.  Weird.

                 BOBBY

                 ARTHUR
       Apparently Cyrus wasn't too keen
       on privacy.

                 KATHY
       I hope the bathroom's in the
       basement.

Arthur pushes the door open, and they enter...

INT. MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

The group comes into the entryway.  Like an airlock, the
outer door closes before the inner one will open.

                 MAGGIE
       I did mention I don't do windows,
       didn't I?

The walls of the entryway are lined with rare ancient
documents in exquisite cases, archeological treasures,
recognizably priceless antiques.  The group looks
around, amazed.

With fascination, Arthur studies the text on the walls.

                 ARTHUR
            (under his breath)
       Latin...

                 KATHY
       Dad, this stuff must be worth
       a fortune.

                 ARTHUR
       Yeah.  That occurred to me.

With a huge smile Bobby reaches for an ancient samurai
sword on display.  Arthur catches him in mid act.

                 ARTHUR
       In your dreams, kiddo.

They come to a great hall, a soaring open space with a
large stained glass ceiling and, strangely, an equally
large brass and copper floor.  With only one other door
at its opposite end, the room is a great glass cube.

                 RAFKIN
            (under his breath)
       Ohhh, Cyrus.  What did you do...

                 ARTHUR
       Okay.  First rule.  No throwing
       stones.

                 BEN
       It's marvelous, isn't it?  A
       living work of art.

A few chuckles.  But Rafkin looks troubled.  Sweat
beads on his forehead.  His head is killing him, and
he's rubbing incessantly on his temples.

                 RAFKIN
            (to Ben)
       Excuse me, the sooner you show me
       where you hid the basement the
       sooner I'm outta here --

                 BEN
       I believe it's down the hall,
       second door on the right.

Rafkin walks off, holding his head, leaving the others
still examining the house.

Bobby's eye catches on the design in the floor made of a
series of concentric metal rings.  There's a brass disk
in the center, two feet in diameter, with symbols etched
into its surface, spinning slowly.

Bobby goes to place his foot on it, when Arthur lifts him
up.

                 ARTHUR
       Don't touch anything.  At least
       until we got some property
       insurance.

He places Bobby down beside Kathy and Maggie.

                 BEN
       Arthur, we have some papers to
       sign in the library.  After that,
       I'll give you a tour of the place.

Arthur turns to the three of them.

                 KATHY

       What happened to checking out our
       new digs?

                 ARTHUR
       You can see it all from here.

                 KATHY
       Dad... you're being paranoid and
       overprotective.

       you guys too well.
            (points to spot)
       Stay.  Right.  Here.  I mean it.

The three of them nod, appeasing him.  Arthur and Ben
walk off.

After a beat, Kathy, Maggie and Bobby slip away...

INT. BASEMENT

Rafkin descends the stairs.  Downstairs is a maze of
narrow glass corridors.  Not much else.  It's all very
clean and sterile.  Not a spider web in the joint.  In
fact, there's nothing alive down here.

Rafkin removes a pair of ghost glasses.  Slips them on.
An AUDIO PIERCING GAINS in VOLUME with every step Rafkin
takes.

THROUGH GHOST GLASSES

                 RAFKIN
       Alright, you sick bastard, where'd
       you put my money?

As soon as Rafkin reaches the bottom step, he's assaulted
full force by the psychic waves around him.

       Aaahh!!

                                (CONTINUED)

He keels over and vomits.

The assault becomes too much, he collapses against a wall.

When he doubles over in pain... we reveal a ghost behind
him in the glass.  It's a teenager from the '50s, a high-
schooler in a letterman's coat, the victim of a horrific
auto crash.  He holds a baseball bat menacingly over his
shoulder.

Rafkin, sensing its proximity, turns as the ghost swings
the bat with all his might.  Instinctively Rafkin leaps
back, but the glass holding the ghost holds.  With
exception of the red symbols that EXPLODE across its
surface, the barrier remains intact.

But the ghost within is suddenly gone...

Rafkin lands with fright a few feet back up the hallway.

                 RAFKIN
       Sweet Jesus... not you.

As he turns about him, another ghost launches out of the
darkness at him, only to be stopped by the glass.  It's
an older, Pilgrimess woman in stocks.

Rafkin's jolted by this vision.  He's driven to the other
side of the hallway.  Again, when he turns around, the
ghost is gone.  He turns to face the Fat Man and the
Little Woman ghosts.

This sends him flying.

Rafkin races back down the corridor in shock.  Soon he's
lost in the underground maze of glass, confused by all
the twists and turns.

He finally reaches the foot of the stairs.

And bolts up them...

Arthur's attention is now drawn to the rare collection
of books piled up against the walls.  We PAN, FOLLOWING
Arthur, discovering a pair of ghost glasses on a shelf.

                 ARTHUR
       This is incredible, Chaucer,
       Dickens, Hemingway... these are all
       first editions.

Arthur carefully handles the books.

                 BEN
       Your uncle was quite a collector.
       Of many things.

Ben removes a folder of papers from his briefcase.  Lays
them across the desk.  Hands Arthur a pen.  Arthur
reluctantly pulls himself away from collection.

                 BEN
       I've highlighted where you're
       supposed to sign.
            (indicating)

Arthur takes the pen from him, pauses.

                 ARTHUR
       Look, I didn't want to bring this
       up in front of the kids.  This
       place... it's amazing, and we're
       extremely grateful, believe me,
       but I don't know how we can
       afford it... I'm just a teacher...
       and the taxes on it must be...

       had...

                 BEN
       Not to worry, Arthur, your uncle
       was a genius with finances.  He
       took care of everything.  Estate
       taxes.  Inheritance taxes, you name
       it.  You'll never have to worry
       about money ever again.

Arthur takes this in.  Scans the documents.  Finds
the highlighted area, and is just about to sign, when...

                 BEN
       Next time learn to duck...

He turns a corner, following the path known only to him.
It leads the lawyer to a dead end.

Ben feels along the edge of the panel.  The glass door
snaps open, lightning fast.  Ben grins, then carefully
steps in...

INT. CLOCKWORK ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Ben makes his way around the huge gear works, and
approaches the control panel.  Smiling, the lawyer spots
a black briefcase sitting on a scale next to the
mechanism.

                 BEN
       I gotta hand it to you, Cyrus
       Kriticos, you're a man of your
       word.

Ben picks up the briefcase; as he does, it sets off a
trigger beneath it.

The house begins to make noises.  Behind him, GEARS
GRINDING, WHIRRING, CLICKING, CLUNKING.  Something has
been turned on.

Ben hardly notices; he's intent on the briefcase.  He
opens it.  It's filled with bundles of cash.  Ben smiles,
still nervous.  He closes the briefcase, and leaves the
room with it.

EXT. HOUSE

From outside the house we witness the unbelievable.
Rooms shift, walls migrate, the whole of the house
reconfigures its architecture to accommodate some hidden
agenda within.

33

INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

Rafkin and Arthur also witness a change.  From their
perspective, they can see from the inside what the
outside was doing.  It's obvious by their shared looks
that maybe it's time to take their argument outside.

       Look, I don't know what's going on

       family of yours, get them out of
       this house.

Arthur doesn't need convincing.

                 ARTHUR
       I'll take your word for it.

They quickly rush out of the study, and over to the
entryway.  But the kids and Maggie are not there...

       They're kids, what do you expect?

                 ARTHUR
       Alright, fine, you check
       downstairs, I'll check up.

Arthur takes off around the corner.  Rafkin stares at
the basement door.

                 RAFKIN
            (to himself)
       There's no way in hell I'm going
       back down there...
            (beat)
       Time for this psychic to leave...

He takes a few steps towards the front door, as Arthur's
VOICE ECHOES through the house, looking for his kids.

                 RAFKIN
            (hesitating)
       Shit, shit, shit...

Rafkin watches as a set of glass panels close across the
front door, sealing them in.

He reaches the top of the stairs leading up to the second
level, when he hits glass.  The stairs have been sealed
off from the shift in the house.

       Bobby.  Kathy!

                 ARTHUR

Arthur bangs like a madman on the glass.

                 ARTHUR
            (begins yelling)
       Bobby!!  Kathy!!

Finally the house relents.  The glass barrier slides open.
Arthur bolts down the hallway.

36

INT. BASEMENT - WITH BEN - SAME TIME

36

Ben heads back the way he came, wearing the glasses.  He
walks past the rooms again.  As he approaches one, a
naked female suicide victim with dead eyes, her wrists
slashed, her bloodstained hands wielding a knife, comes
up to the glass.  Ben stops to check her out.

                 BEN
       What's the matter?  Life got you
       down?

The Suicide stares at him now with hatred.  Her entire
eyes are ink black, her face sallow, sucked in, her
runny mascara stains cascading down her bloodless cheeks.
She launches herself against the glass, clawing and
scratching to get to him.  Ben shudders, thinking he
might've crossed a line, begins to back away.

As the basement around Ben Moss suddenly begins to shift.
The lawyer turns about, watching with unrest as the
mechanical gears all around him engage... shifting
rooms... rearranging walls...

Ben turns to see the door that held the Suicide back
slides open.

                 BEN
       Hey, I was only kidding...

The ghost steps into the hallway towards Ben, blocking
the route to the stairs.  Ben back-pedals in horror.
Backing right into an open doorway...

As he steps over the threshold, there's a flicker of
light in the doorway, and a sharp SNICK.

Ben stands in the doorway, surprised, apparently
paralyzed.  His glasses tumble off his face, stems sliced
through.  The briefcase in his hand also seems to be
sliced.  Half of it falls and halves of dollar bills
spill out onto the floor.

Ben slowly slides to the ground.  Or at least his front
half does.  The glass door has snapped shut like a razor
blade.  Bisecting him laterally, slicing straight through
his body.

His front half slides down, revealing, for a second, a
cross sectional view of his back half on the far side of
the glass.

As Ben's remains collapse wetly to the floor, the Suicide
smiles and vanishes...

Above the row of levers we see a series of 13 meters at
the base of the pendulum.  All read.  The needle on the

On the floor of the great hall, the RING stops spinning
with a CLICK.  The symbol on the innermost ring (the same

the other two to check it out.

                 KATHY
       I'll be in here.

Bobby and Maggie continue on.  Bobby turns on his
microphone.

                 BOBBY
            (recording)
       We are now upstairs... and
       there's... more glass.

Bobby clicks off the microphone.  Then removes his
scooter from his bag.

                 BOBBY
       Race you to the end of the
       hall...?

                 MAGGIE
       I really don't think you should be
       riding that in --

And suddenly Maggie breaks out into a sprint.  Bobby
quickly jumps on his scooter, but he's too far behind to
catch up.

                 BOBBY
       Hey, you cheated!

They reach the end of the hall.

                 BOBBY
       That wasn't fair, I didn't say
       start.

                 MAGGIE
       Gotta be on your toes, kid.

Maggie walks into one of the rooms.  Bobby follows her.

INT. BOBBY'S BEDROOM

The room's filled with all types of cool, macabre, boy
stuff.  A seven-year-old's dream, if you were a demented
seven-year-old.

                 BOBBY
       This is definitely my room.

       So, do I look cool?

       No, you look like a dork...

But the nanny isn't listening.  She sits there, slack-
jawed.

                 MAGGIE
            (looking through
             glasses)
       My God... this is... incredible...

MAGGIE'S POV THROUGH GHOST GLASSES

The etched glass symbols on the wall have been added to
with flowing red, glowing symbols.  Not only do they
weave in and about the walls, but they create a path on
the floor that leads right out the door.

BACK TO SCENE

                 BOBBY
       What?  Lemme see.

       One second.

       C'mon...

Bobby grabs at them.  Maggie takes them off.

                 MAGGIE
       Alright, alright... here...

Bobby puts them on, and reacts.

       Cool!

                 BOBBY

Bobby grabs his scooter and mike, and takes off down the
hall.  Maggie gives chase, but it's obvious she's not
going to catch him.

He zooms in and out of the bedrooms, up and down the
halls, following the glowing red path.

He takes a couple of turns when he realizes he may have
gone too far.  The boy has become lost in all the glass.
Bobby is alone.

       Maggie...?

                 BOBBY

Bobby starts scooting again, only this time with a bit
more urgency.

He passes an open door, which opens into a set of stairs
heading down.  He stops, backs up, then glances down.  At
the bottom of the nearest landing, he catches the glimpse
of a figure standing.  The female figure is in
silhouette, and her head is tilted oddly to one side,
though from this distance, we can't see why.

       Kathy??

                 BOBBY

The figure oddly shuffles off.

                 BOBBY
       C'mon, Kath, stop playing games.

With his scooter under his arm, Bobby heads downstairs,
into the darkness of the house.

                 BOBBY

INT. KATHY'S BEDROOM (SECOND FLOOR)

Kathy walks in, but not before she notices that, from the
hallway, the room appears to be empty.  The glass door,
we now realize, is "trick" glass.

                 KATHY
       This place is awesome.

Kathy walks over to the bed.  Plops down, sinking into
all the silk.  Her half-closed eyes tell us -- puurrfect.

Out of the corner of her eye, she spots a door ajar, with
the lights on inside.

       No way...

                 KATHY

She slips off the bed, opening the door, revealing her
new bathroom.  And if ever a room could be carved from a
single diamond, this is it.

                 KATHY
       Now that's what I'm talkin' about!

                                      43.

44

It's spectacular.  Immaculate.  And not only spacious,
but appointed.  The shelves are stacked with jewel-like
bottles of perfume.  Kathy's wet dream.

As we VIEW her FROM BENEATH the glass shelves, she begins
inspecting her own found treasure.  Everything seems to
be unashamedly brand-new.

                 KATHY
       We've struck gold.

ANOTHER ANGLE

What she also doesn't notice is a pair of ghost glasses
lying on the sink.  The CAMERA ZOOMS IN THROUGH the
lenses, so that we're now looking at the scene...

THROUGH GHOST GLASSES

And a figure passes behind Kathy, jolting us.  The figure
heads for the tub.  The CAMERA TURNS TOWARDS the figure,
REVEALING a new level of hell.  There's blood spattered
everywhere in the bathroom.  We PAN.  The gore is
overwhelming.

Still lost in her personal nirvana, Kathy nonchalantly
strolls over to the bathtub, drawing back its
bloodstained curtain.  In a TIGHT SHOT, she runs the
water, which is blood-red.  On the CUT, she brings it up
to her face where it's warm, clear and perfect.

When she leans back a bit, we see the naked female
suicide ghost lying in the bloody tub, wrists slashed,
eyes staring at Kathy, wickedly.

Kathy doesn't see her, because she's not wearing the
glasses.

Two words are written in blood on the glass walls
surrounding the tub:

                 I'M SORRY

Kathy's oblivious of the Suicide, lost in the
possibilities of her bathroom.  Running her hand around
the bloody water.  She turns the water off... and as soon
as she does, a knife pierces the surface of the water.

                 KATHY
       It doesn't get any better than
       this.

Suddenly, the Suicide rises up with the rest of her
knife, reaching for Kathy, when --

There's BANGING on the bathroom door.  Kathy bolts
upright.

BACK TO SCENE

We snap out of the ghost glasses, and the bathroom's back
to normal.  All clean glass block.  An empty tub.

Kathy opens the locked bathroom door... and Arthur's
standing there, pissed.  He yanks her out of the
bathroom, into the hall.

                 ARTHUR
       What the hell're you doin' up
       here?  Didn't I tell you to stay

INT. MAIN LEVEL

They reach the bottom of the stairs, and head over to the
front door.  But there's now a glass barrier in front of
it, barring anyone from exit.

                 KATHY
       What happened to the door?

                 ARTHUR
       Son of a bitch.

Arthur picks up a chair and hurls it at the glass.  It
bounces off without a dent.  He picks it up and starts
banging away.  Nothing.  Over the top of the noise a voice
bellows out.

                 ARTHUR
       What a night I'm having!

                 RAFKIN (O.S.)

Bobby is zipping down the hallway on his scooter.  He
takes the corners at high speed, following the spell
markings on the floor.

                 BOBBY
       Kathy!  Come on.

As he rounds the next turn too fast, his scooter shoots
out from under him, his glasses sail off his head...

       Aahh!

                 BOBBY

Bobby grabs his glasses again, and when he slips them
on!--

THROUGH GHOST GLASSES

He sees a decapitated head lying on the floor right
between his legs, wrapped in plastic.  The head's eyes
snap open, and it begins to mouth words.

Bobby screams... then he hears a DRAGGING sound behind
him, like dead skin slapping on glass.

Bobby turns and sees a headless, legless human torso,
wrapped in sheets of filthy plastic, crab-walking towards
him...

       Daaddd!!!!

                 BOBBY

Bobby jumps to his feet, turning.  He runs down the hall.
Looks back, sees nothing, then when he turns back,
straight into the bound woman.

Pinned against the glass, the bound woman lets out a
muffled cry.

Strangled by a businessman's tie, which is still cinched
tight around her neck, her tongue sticks out like a thick
blue thumb.  Her hair, skin, and prom dress are clotted
with dirt and worms -- the marks of a shallow grave.  Her
hands and feet are bound by rope, but that's not the
worst.  Her head sits askew on her shoulders, neck
obviously broken, a chunk of bone jutting out just
beneath the skin.

Panicked, she goes into violent convulsions.

It's too much for Bobby.  He turns and bolts, racing
blindly through the basement's glass hallways.  When
finally he feels safe, he slows enough to look over his
shoulder, and that's when he slams into a wall of glass.

The collision knocks his glasses from his head, his mike
from his shoulder.  He reaches for his glasses when the
tiny sound of a SQUEAKING WHEEL issues FROM his MIKE
down the hall.

Bobby looks at the mike, then fearfully back at the
glasses in his hands.  Ushering all his courage, Bobby
dons the glasses, and with his heart beating like a
hummingbird's, he turns around, and sees...

Another WOMAN there, walking down the corridor towards
him.  Dressed in only a hospital gown, she wheels a
portable IV stand along the floor.  Yards of thin plastic
IV tubes tether her to the stand.  Her arms, thin,
withered from long illness, bear nasty scars from
unnumbered operations.  Her head is almost completely
covered in stained bandages, but a beauty mark decorates
that portion of her face we can see.

She gropes blindly down the passage, straight towards
Bobby.

He backs up, trips over his feet, almost falls.

The IV Woman stops.  So does Bobby.

Bobby waits, frozen.  He tries to call for help, but can
only manage a gasp.

                 BOBBY
       D-Dad... Daddy...
            (louder)
       Dad!  Dad!

The IV Woman seems to respond to the sound of his voice.
She cocks her head, as if listening.  She moves, calling
out, but we hear it THROUGH the tiny amplifier of Bobby's
TOY MIKE.

                 JEAN (V.O.)
            (on mike)
       B-bb-bobby?

And now he recognizes her voice -- it's his mother, Jean.
That's it.  Bobby turns and runs like hell.  Around the
corner, and right into --

Cyrus.  Or Cyrus's ghost.  Pale white, with eyes rolled
back, and a big spike sticking out of his neck.  Standing
behind a pane of glass.  Bobby actually hit glass, and he
catches a glimpse of the dead Cyrus just before he's
knocked out from the impact.

As his glasses and microphone fall to the floor, we...

       Hey, Glass Family Robinson!
       You're wasting your breath!
       This stuff --
            (taps glass)
       This is Ectobar Glass, Cyrus invented
       it.  It's shatterproof and soundproof.
       So your kid might have a hard time
       hearing you.

Maggie touches the etchings on the glass.

                 MAGGIE
       What are these?

                 RAFKIN
       They're containment spells.
       Ectoplasmic entities can't
       cross them.  The supernatural has
       laws to obey just like we do.  In
       the case of ghosts, it's spells.
       Written, spoken, it doesn't matter.
       They have to obey what the spells
       tell them.

                 KATHY
       So what do these do?

       Alright, ghosts.  And not Casper the
       friendly kind either.  Cyrus had a
       thing for hunting the more powerful
       of the species.  Why, I got no idea.

                 ARTHUR
       I thought you didn't want to go
       through it again.

                 RAFKIN
       You know, you're right.  I've wasted
       enough time on small minds tonight.

       Hey!

                 KATHY

                 RAFKIN
       I was talking about your father.

                 MAGGIE
       Excuse me... did you say hunted?

                 RAFKIN
       Yup, and his trophies are all
       locked up in the basement.

       This basement?

                 MAGGIE

                 RAFKIN
       What's with you people?  Are you
       slow?  Of course this basement.
       If it was next door I wouldn't
       give a shit.  Here, I'll prove it...

Rafkin pulls out his glasses.

                 RAFKIN
       You can see them with these.
       They're spectral viewers.

                 MAGGIE
       I gave Bobby a pair of those.

This gets Arthur's attention.

Maggie walks over and takes them out of Rafkin's hand.
Slips them on.

Rafkin takes the glasses back.  Looks down.  Impressed.

                 RAFKIN
       Huh.  Hidden barrier spells.  Cyrus
       must've needed more protective zones.

They come to a staircase, leading down into the basement.

They stop and look at him.

       What did I just say?  There's a
       petting zoo in the basement?  No,
       Arthur, I succinctly said there
       are ghosts in the basement.

       You also said they were locked up.

Arthur extends his hand.

       Deal?

                 ARTHUR

Arthur extends his hand.  And for the first time Dennis
Rafkin isn't afraid of the gesture.  Not that he takes it,
of course.

       Deal.

Rafkin pulls out a bottle of prescription drugs, swigs it
down, swigs it all down, then joins them down the staircase.

The group comes to the bottom of the stairs, then moves
into the glass-lined passage.  Rafkin's head is beginning
to throb again.  Arthur, taking note.

       You going to be okay?

                 RAFKIN
       Yeah.  Just keep an eye on me, okay?

The four search the empty basement hallways, finding
nothing but more glass and shadows.  They come to an
intersection in the huge labyrinth.

Rafkin checks one of the containment cubes, finding its
door still locked.

                 ARTHUR
       The place is too big.  Kathy and
       I'll go this way, you two head
       down there.

                 RAFKIN
       Sure.  Ignore the professional...
       Look, don't go too far.  A straight
       line then turn around.  We'll meet
       back in five -- alright?

Arthur nods.  Takes Kathy by the arm, and they head off in
one direction, leaving Maggie and Rafkin to go the other way.

Which is exactly what Rafkin didn't want to hear...
especially in the basement.  Maggie doesn't look too
worried about things.  Taking things rather nonchalantly,
while Rafkin appears the frightened rabbit.

                 RAFKIN
       Look, you don't believe me, do you?
       See for yourself...

Rafkin puts the Ghost Glasses on Maggie, and pulls her
in front of the first glass cube.

                 MAGGIE
       I thought we've been over this.
       I can't see any ghosts.

       There.

Rafkin points into one of the cubes.

       Where?

                 MAGGIE

Maggie looks around intently, but comes back confused.
Rafkin looks at her, wondering.  He pulls the glasses
off her face and puts them on his own.  He's shocked.
The first two cubes are empty.

       Oh, no...

Rafkin paces in front of the cubes.  He peers worriedly
into the next cube.  At first he sees nothing, when
suddenly, a hammer slams against the glass.  Rafkin
whoops and jumps backwards.  He grabs his heart.

                 RAFKIN
       Never fails... they always wait
       for you to put your face right up
       near the glass...

Maggie eyes him warily.  Rafkin takes off the glasses
and puts them on Maggie.  She looks into the cube.  And
screams.

THROUGH GHOST GLASSES

A hugely-built middle-aged BLACK MAN appears, dressed in
layers of viciously torn leather, with a blacksmith apron
covering what remains.  In addition, nails and spikes are
hammered into his body, from his head down to the sledge-
hammer that's been nailed to his handless arm.

                 MAGGIE
       Oh my God... it's a... it's a...

                 RAFKIN
       That's right, we're surrounded by
       'em all the time.  Most of 'em
       can't hurt us.  Most of 'em don't
       want to hurt us... but there are
       exceptions.

The apparition glares at Rafkin.  He takes hold of a
spike embedded deep in his shoulder and pulls.  All eight
inches of rusting metal comes out.  He thrusts it at the
glass, and pulls it across the surface in a shower of
sparks, as if carving a hello from Hell.

                 MAGGIE
       What's he doing?

                 RAFKIN
       Just saying hi.  I helped put him
       here.

The ghost lowers his spike.  Into the glass he has etched
the phrase "U MYN."  Dennis takes a beat, then licks the
glass.

Lightning quick, the apparition lifts his hammer and
smashes it against the glass.  Sparks explode across the
corridor.  Maggie jumps back into Rafkin's arms.

                 MAGGIE
       Okay, I wanna go now...

Maggie swallows hard.  Rafkin, half smiling, gestures
down the corridor, and reluctantly, she follows.

At the last moment, Rafkin turns and flips the hammer the
bird.  But the ghost is gone...

Bobby lies on the floor.  He rises, shaky, turns -- and
realizes that he's trapped in a space perhaps twenty feet
wide by ten feet long, surrounded on all four sides by
glass walls.  Other spaces are dimly visible through the
glass.  He looks around.  No way out.

Then, on the other side of the glass wall, he sees Arthur
moving down the passage on the other side.

       Dad!  Dad!

                 BOBBY

But Arthur cannot hear or see him.  An instant later,
Kathy comes INTO VIEW...

He bangs on the glass, but his fists hardly make a sound.

Arthur charges forward, searching.  Kathy stays close.

                 KATHY
       We're gonna get lost...

And on that note, Arthur turns the corner, and finds
Bobby's microphone and glasses lying in the middle of the
corridor floor.  He stops in his tracks.  Kathy notices
them too.

Both of them fear the worst.  They slowly walk over to
the items.  Arthur picks up Bobby's microphone, while
Kathy grabs his glasses.

Arthur presses PLAY on the RECORDER -- Bobby's last words
bellow out.

                 BOBBY (V.O.)
            (screaming on recorder)
       Dad!  Dad!!

Arthur quickly clicks the RECORDER OFF.  He tries to keep
it together, but we can see the pain on his face.  Kathy
breaks down.

ON Bobby's side of the wall, Bobby pounds on the glass as
he sees Arthur comfort Kathy with a hug.

The wall behind him begins to move -- pushing in.  He
gasps, and scrambles back as it comes forward, the space
in which he's trapped in getting narrower.

And to make matters worse, Arthur and Kathy vanish from
his sight behind the "trick" glass.  Bobby's about to
lose it...

       ... there's no such thing as --

... revealing a face from Hell before her -- the Jackal.

THROUGH GHOST GLASSES

With unnaturally long limbs and fingers with long, jagged
nails; its sloping head and bulging eyes contained in the
cage it wears on his head, the Jackal stands before Kathy
in a shredded straitjacket, half torn off, half burned

Kathy screams as she's literally propelled down the hall.

ARTHUR'S POV

At the end of the corridor, Kathy is seen being dragged
invisibly across the floor, pinned to the wall, then
dragged up it to the ceiling.

       Daddy!  Help me!!  Oh God!!

savagely tearing his daughter apart.

                 ARTHUR
       Kathy!  What is it?  I can't see a
       thing!

Arthur grabs Kathy, tries to drag her away.  But the
Jackal won't let go.  Kathy is hoisted in the air between
the two, a tug of war that's killing her.  Arthur won't
let go of her hands and the invisible Jackal won't let go
of her feet.  Bloody scratches rip open along her legs as
her clothes are ripped to shreds.

                 KATHY
       Make it let go!  Make it let go!

Arthur grabs all the material he can and pulls.  It
tears.  Kathy rebounds, almost falling.

The Jackal leaps on her like a hellish animal, scratching
her with both fingers and toes.  She screams over and
over.  Arthur sees bloody scratches appear on Kathy's
skin, deep, red, sharp.

                 ARTHUR
       Jesus Christ, get off!  Get off!

Hysterical, Arthur finally pulls Kathy up and drags her
down  the  passage.    The  Jackal  leaps  again,  yanking  her  from
Arthur's grasp.

Arthur barely catches hold of Kathy's arm and pulls.

But the Jackal's too strong... and he's losing her...

Suddenly, the corridor lights up behind him, and a
phosphorous flare is tossed to the floor beside him.

The JACKAL SHRIEKS with unearthly horror!

A second set of hands grabs hold of Kathy and pulls
alongside Arthur.  Arthur turns and comes face-to-face
with Kalina, knapsack slung over her shoulder, glasses on
her face.  He does a double-take, then --

                 ARTHUR
       Who the hell're you?

       Pull!!

                 KALINA

Together, the two pull Kathy down the hall, away from the
Jackal.

The Jackal regains his wits and attacks.  It's a race
now.

                 KALINA
       Run, goddammit!!!

Arthur and Kalina drag Kathy down the hall, trying to
outrun the Jackal.

The Jackal suddenly slams into an invisible barrier.

Kathy reacts with astonishment as the ghost rips and
tears into the barrier like a wild animal trying to get
at meat... sparks fly.

The trio tries to regain themselves around the corner.
Kathy's in Arthur's arms, cut, bruised, crying.  He
looks up with fire in his eyes at Kalina --

use.  The hallways all look the same.

Pulling her around a corner, they find themselves
trapped.  A glass barrier cuts them off from the rest of
the corridor.

       Shit!!  Gotta go back.

Rafkin grabs Maggie, turns, suddenly stops.  He looks

Kathy passes the glasses to her father.  He holds them
for an instant, then puts them on.

The Jackal's some three feet away -- scratching insanely
at the glowing red spells that block his way.

                        ARTHUR
            (studying the Jackal)
       Unbelievable...

                 KALINA
       Another one of your uncle's victims.

                 ARTHUR

       Victims?

When Arthur looks back, the Jackal's gone...

                 KALINA
       Yeah, your uncle had a nasty habit
       of enslaving souls.  That's why
       I'm here.  It doesn't matter
       whether they're dead or not,
       they're still people.

Kathy looks up, bloody, trembling, angry, like this
woman's crazy.

                 ARTHUR
       How the hell did you get in here?

                 KALINA
       I eased in through an opening when
       the house shifted.

Kathy looks to her father with hope.

                 KALINA
       Don't get your hopes up.  It's
       closed now, and it's not gonna
       happen again.

       The Arcanum.  It belonged to my
       fiance.  He and your uncle had
       the only two known copies in the
       world.

Kalina flips through the book.

                 KALINA
       It was penned in the fifteenth
       century by an astrologer named
       Basileus.  In it he describes
       the building of a certain device.
       One that can see into the future,
       As legend has it, it was described
       to him while under demonic
       possession.
            (beat)
       Needless to say, his book didn't
       make the Best Seller's List.
       After reading it, the church
       burned him at the stake.  His
       writings, however, survived.
            (looking around)
       I just can't believe he built
       it...

                 ARTHUR
       What're you talking about?

                 KALINA
       Basileus' device.  The Eye of
       Hell.

            (beat)
       You're standing in the middle of a
       machine designed by the Devil...

Rafkin and Maggie continue down the dark corridor.  A
figure moves in and out of shadows following them.
Rafkin notices the lurking ghost with the glasses.

                 RAFKIN
       We got company...

He hurries Maggie down the corridor.  Suddenly,
another figure, the Suicide, crosses the corridor in
front of them, slipping into the shadows.

       See what?  I don't have glasses,
       you moron.

Rafkin backs down the hall, Maggie behind him.

He catches a quick glimpse of the first figure again.
This time it's closer.

He re-checks the other corridor, and the Suicide is there.

                 MAGGIE

       What is it?

                 RAFKIN
       If it's down here it's not a good
       thing, trust me.

Rafkin spins around, and the '50s kid is on top of him.

He swings his bat madly at Rafkin, connecting on the
last swing.  Rafkin, in an explosion of sparks, goes
sailing.

Maggie quickly scoops Rafkin up and starts hauling him
down the corridor with the Suicide in pursuit.

       This is good.  All we need is a
       little cooperation from you and that
       book, and we can all go home.
       Correct?

                 KALINA
       Alright, I'll help you get out but
       you, in turn, have to help me.  I
       came here to free those trapped by
       your uncle.  Tonight.  You want out?
       You have to help me, too.

       Do I have a choice?

                 KALINA
       Yeah.  I could free us all.  Here.

Kalina opens her bag, exposing sticks of dynamite.
Arthur swallows hard.  This wasn't the option he had

       Al-right... this is negotiable.

Arthur turns around to see -- Kathy's gone.

Arthur searches everywhere, but it appears that Kathy's
just vanished.

                 ARTHUR
       No!!  This can't be happening!!

Kalina watches him lose it.  She notices something move
above her.

       C'mon, we gotta get out of here.

Kalina gestures to a little boy ghost standing on the
ceiling.  The ghost issues a hateful, unholy hiss.  Arthur
notices him and quickly changes his mind.

They flee down the corridor, until they finally see the
stairs coming up.  Freedom.  One last corner to go,
when -- wham -- show's over.

A sheet of glass blocks their path to the stairs.
What's worse is that when they turn around -- the
ghost is gone.

The HOUSE suddenly begins to MOVE again.  At the end of
the HALLWAY a door opens, while walls around them start to
CLOSE IN and crush them.

                 RAFKIN

Rafkin shoves her out of the crushing hallway, as the
wall forces him into the open doorway.

The glass WALL SLAMS CLOSED between them, and the house
goes silent again.  Stops moving.

Rafkin and Maggie can see each other through the glass.
Rafkin notices the glasses in Maggie's hand.

His head begins pounding.  Something's not right.  Then
he turns around, and realizes where he is...

INT. HAMMER'S ROOM

                 RAFKIN
       Oh, shit... go around to the door
       and toss me the glasses.

Maggie walks around the corner, and sees the Suicide
standing there.  She quickly backpedals back to where
she was before.

                 MAGGIE
       That idea ain't gonna work, you
       gotta plan B?

She looks back THROUGH the glass for Rafkin, and spots --

The Hammer is standing right behind him, smiling.

Rafkin reacts to Maggie's panicked look.

                 RAFKIN
            (mouthing)

       What?

The Hammer raises his weapon, about to swing down on
Rafkin.  Maggie quickly points to the side away from
the Hammer.

       Move!

                 MAGGIE

Rafkin jumps over as the Hammer swings.  The Hammer
strikes the floor where Rafkin just was.  Sparks fly.

Rafkin nervously looks at Maggie.

       The spells?  Where... are...

Maggie checks the floor.  She notices the glowing spells,

gone...

reappears and swings, missing Rafkin and hitting an
invisible wall.  More sparks fly.

Rafkin's sweating profusely now.  He doesn't move.  He's
standing on the spells.  One wrong step and he's dead.
He glances around knowing the Hammer's presence is very
close by.

to make a run for it.

                 RAFKIN
       You have to... lead me... out.

Maggie looks down at the path of spells on the floor,
and it's a jagged path to the door.

Then she sees the Hammer standing over Rafkin like an
executioner, waiting to bring down his ax.  One wrong
step, and...

       Oh, crap.

                        MAGGIE

Rafkin looks at her hopefully.  Maggie nods.

       Okay.  Right foot.  Step right.

       Right?

                 RAFKIN

Maggie nods.  Rafkin raises his right foot, hovering it
over the floor, looking for Maggie to okay the step.
She nods again.  Rafkin takes the step.

Rafkin squints, ready to get hit.  But the Hammer's gone.

       Whew...

Rafkin sets his left foot forward.  Again he's safe.

Maggie nods, motioning him straight, onward.  Another safe
step.  He might just make it out of here alive after all.

And that's when Maggie sees the Suicide turn the
corridor and she's coming right at her.

Maggie, scared out of her wits, wants to run, but she
still has to deal with Rafkin.

       Another right.

                 MAGGIE

Rafkin goes to take a step with his right foot, and walk
right off the spells.  Maggie's not watching, she's more
concerned with the Suicide heading in her direction.

Maggie turns back just in time and sees the Hammer right
in front of Rafkin --

                 MAGGIE
       Shit!  Just jump!

Rafkin takes a flying leap towards the door.

He makes it out safely, and rushes over to Maggie.  Gives
her a big "thank you" kiss on the lips.

                 RAFKIN

Everything looks clear.  But it's all the dark areas of

Seeing movements that may or may not be there.

       We gotta get to the library.  It
       has spell protection all around
       it.

                 ARTHUR
       Where is it from here?

Kalina shifts the book around to see where they are.

                 KALINA
       Above us, to the right.

Kalina notices the glass blocks above them in the
ceiling.  Arthur sees where she's going with this, and
we...

                                CUT TO:

INT. MAIN FLOOR - CORRIDOR - WITH RAFKIN AND MAGGIE 

69

Rafkin and Maggie have backed themselves into a corner.
Rafkin's looking at two figures, the Fat Man and the
Little Woman, making their way down the corridors to
them.

                 MAGGIE
            (panicked)
       Just tell me when I'm supposed to
       scream, because I ain't gonna die
       without screaming my goddamn head
       off!

Rafkin's looking at the two ghosts, the Fat Man and
Little Woman, through the glasses.  They quickly slip
back into the darkness.  He notices the pilgrims on
the other end of the corridor.  They're being cornered.

                 RAFKIN
       Not yet, but take a deep breath.

Suddenly, a glass block in the floor behind them pops
open, and a flare is tossed through.

It lands on the floor, illuminating the corridor.

The ghostly figures quickly disperse...

A hand appears, and Kalina is shoved through the hole.
Maggie screams.  Rafkin freaks --

                 RAFKIN
       What the hell --

INT. BASEMENT - WITH ARTHUR

                                      73.

Kalina's legs disappear through the ceiling.  Arthur,
holding out the flare, scans the basement around him.

The figures still remain at bay.  That's when the flare
burns out.

Arthur shakes it once, twice, then, knowing it's out for
good, stands alone, helpless in the single patch of light
coming from the ceiling.

He looks to his left and sees the crab-like creature
scurrying down the corridor.  From the other direction
comes a large silhouette (which is the Hammer).

       Ms. Ortezia...

                 ARTHUR

71

INT. MAIN FLOOR - CORRIDOR - WITH RAFKIN, MAGGIE AND
KALINA

Kalina notices the two of them.  Rafkin recognizes her.
She recognizes him.

                 RAFKIN
       What are you doing here?

                 KALINA
       I should ask you the same
       question.  Heretic.

       Hack.

                 RAFKIN

They both size each other up.

                 ARTHUR (O.S.)
            (calling up from
             below)
       Hey!  Remember me?!

Rafkin and Maggie peer into the hole and see Arthur
below.

                 KALINA
       Oh, shit!  Pull him up!  Pull him
       up!!

Rafkin reaches his hand into the hole, and Arthur grabs
it.  They pull him up through the hole... just as the
Hammer swings.  An EXPLOSION of SPARKS ERUPTS in the
basement.

                 KALINA
       Alright, at the end of the hall,
       make a right... then another
       right... then --

                 RAFKIN
       Where we going?

                 KALINA
       The library.  It's the safest
       place in the house, the walls are
       surrounded entirely with spells.

                 RAFKIN
            (re:  her book)
       How the hell would you know?

Kalina holds up the book.  Rafkin ain't biting.

       Trust me.

       Arthur?

       Trust her.

                 KALINA

                 RAFKIN

                 ARTHUR

Arthur notices the flare going out.

                 ARTHUR
       Now could we please just save all
       our questions for the library?

                 KALINA
       Alright, let's move.

Kalina IGNITES another FLARE, and guides them down the
corridors.

                 RAFKIN
       Where'd your daughter go?

                 ARTHUR
       I don't know.  She disappeared.

       How can you lose an entire family
       in a glass house?

Arthur tosses Rafkin a look just as they turn a corner,
and the Jackal leaps out of the shadows and pounces on
Arthur's back.

The Jackal's tearing into Arthur, dragging him down the
hallway.

Kalina tosses her flare down the hall at them, and the
ghost jumps off Arthur, shrieking.

Rafkin quickly grabs Arthur and pulls him into the
library.

They stumble in.

                 ARTHUR
       So much for quicksilver...

                 KALINA
       We should be safe in here...

Arthur lands on the couch, in pain.  Maggie's by his
side.

Rafkin bangs on the glass, pissed.

                 RAFKIN
       Shit, you'd think I'd be used to
       these things by now.

                 KALINA
       They don't seem to like you
       either...

Kalina takes a seat at the desk, begins reading through
her book.

                 KALINA
       ... I wonder why.

                 RAFKIN
       Look, you got something to say,

       Alright... let's start with...
       this is all your fault!  If you
       hadn't caught them, we wouldn't be
       running from them now, would we?

                 RAFKIN
       Hey, I didn't build this house.
       Blame his crazy uncle for that
       one.

                 KALINA
       But you helped him.  How could you
       help him without knowing what he
       was up to?

                 RAFKIN
       I had my reasons.

                 KALINA
       You stole people's souls for
       money.  How depraved is that?

                 RAFKIN
       Before that I was working for a
       psychic hotline.  Try that for
       depraved.
            (beat)
       Look, Cyrus took me in when no one
       else would.  In case you haven't
       noticed... I... am... a... FREAK.
       Dead people give me migraines.  I
       can't touch a single person
       without suddenly seeing all their
       problems.
            (beat)
       Do you know how lonely that is?
       No one accepted me except him.

                 KALINA
       He didn't accept you.  He used
       you.

Rafkin looks away, ashamed.

                 ARTHUR
            (to Kalina)
       Look, cut me some slack, what
       difference does it make?  These
       things are all killers anyway,
       so what do we care?

                 ARTHUR

                 KALINA
       About the fourth ghost?

       Don't do this.

                 RAFKIN

                 KALINA
       He has a right to know.

                 ARTHUR
            (concerned)
       What about the fourth ghost?

                 KALINA
       Let me help you out... St. Luke's
       Hospital, six months ago.

The realization hits Arthur hard.  He turns to Rafkin.

                 ARTHUR
       Jean's... here...?

                 RAFKIN
       I had no idea she was your wife,
       Arthur, I swear.

Arthur clocks Rafkin with a roundhouse punch, sending him
flying over the couch.

                 ARTHUR
       Why?  She never hurt anyone...

                 RAFKIN
       I don't know... Cyrus handpicked
       every one of 'em.  Your wife
       included.  When I realized who
       you were I tried to help --

                 ARTHUR
       Tried to help?!  We're trapped, my
       kids are missing, my wife, who
       should be resting in peace, is
       being held hostage by the house
       from hell, and you call this
       HELP?!  She's right.  This is all
       your goddamn fault.

Rafkin takes the scolding.  Arthur paces the room.

                 ARTHUR
       Son of a bitch!

                 KALINA
       There is a way to save her,
       Arthur.  And your kids, too.

Arthur stops pacing.  Turns to her --

                 KALINA
       This house... it isn't a house,
       it's a machine.  It's a complete
       recreation of Basileus' design.
            (reading from the
             book)
       According to this, there should
       only be twelve earthbound spirits
       trapped inside here.

Arthur walks over and she shows him the book.

                 KALINA
            (re:  book)
       You see these?  They're the Black
       Zodiac.  They represent the
       different ghosts that Cyrus needed
       to catch.
            (reading)
       The Withered Lover, the First Born
       Son, the Torn Prince.  And here...
       the Bound Lady, the Great Child
       and the Dire Mother... the Suicide,
       the Torso, and the Buried Maiden...
       then there's the three death signs,
       the sign of Hell's Winter... the
       Hammer, the Hyena, and the
       Juggernaut...

As Kalina counts through the ghosts of Arthur, forever
the math teacher, instinctively counts them off on his
fingers.  Kalina flips through a few more pages.

                               KALINA

       According to Basileus, this
       machine requires the energy of
       these specific spirits in order
       to bring it to life.  Once
       engaged, the spirits are freed one
       by one, each adding its energy to
       the machine... powering it up.

       Powering it up for what?

                 KALINA
       To open the Ocularis Infernum.

                 RAFKIN
       The Ocularis?  What's that?

                 ARTHUR
       It's Latin.  It means the Eye of
       Hell.

                 MAGGIE
       The Eye of Hell?

                 RAFKIN
       Come on, Arthur.  This is
       bullshit.

                 MAGGIE
       I saw a man carrying his own head.
       The Eye of Hell isn't a stretch.

       Go on.

                 ARTHUR

                 KALINA
       In Hell, there's an eye that sees
       the whole world.  Past and future,
       heaven and earth, the blessed and
       the damned.  If knowledge is
       power, then the man who controls
       the Ocularis would be the most
       powerful man on earth.  Your
       uncle was planning to become God.

A beat passes...

                 ARTHUR
       So how many ghosts have been set
       free?

Kalina checks the book.

       Eleven.

                 KALINA

                 ARTHUR
       And it needs twelve ghosts to

       Uh-uh.  Uh-uh.  What about this
       thirteenth ghost?  Even Damon
       mentioned it.

                 KALINA
       It's a fail safe.  Yes.  In order
       to stop the process.  The house
       needs a sacrifice of life, instead
       of death.
            (beat)
       A willing... human... sacrifice.
       The sacrifice of the Broken Heart.

All eyes turn on Arthur.

                        RAFKIN
       ... the thirteenth ghost...?

                 KALINA
       Exactly.  The thirteenth spirit
       stands before the eye as the final
       configuration culminates.  As the
       eye opens, the spirit uses the
       power of life to, essentially,
       short circuit the system.

                 ARTHUR
       Uses the 'power of life'...?

Kalina swallows hard.

                 KALINA
       By leaping into the eye.

at.

Rafkin takes a seat next to Arthur on the couch.
Kalina's out of earshot, working out their plan.

Arthur thinking, while fidgeting with Rafkin's Power and
Light tool belt, left there from before.

                 ARTHUR
       In case you haven't been counting
       I'm out of time here.  There

Arthur points at one of the doors in the library.  He and
Rafkin remove the hinges off the spell-etched glass door,

spells.  He hands the door to Rafkin.

They're both holding opposite sides of the door.  The
corridor's empty.  Covered with dark patches.  They
carefully inch their way down the corridor, passing
dark areas.

They reach a couple of dark patches, and slowly walk
past.  Prepared for anything...

When suddenly, out of the shadows, the '50s Kid swings

They drive the '50s Kid into the wall.  Pressing the door

is going crazy.  There's a huge burst of ecto-plasmic
sparks, then he vanishes.

After flashing a flare before them, Kalina and Maggie
drop through the ceiling, back into the basement.

They make their way through the glass hallway, coming to
a door.  As Kalina approaches it, she stumbled across
Ben's sliced corpse.

Maggie gasps at the remains.

                 MAGGIE
       Oh... God... Looks like we found
       the lawyer.

                 KALINA

Kalina quickly rushes over to the base of the machine

                 MAGGIE

                 KALINA
       I'm working on it!

Kalina's following the manual.  She studies the different
levers and what each does.

Maggie turns and comes face-to-face with Cyrus's ghost.
She jumps, then quickly jabs the flare at him.  But to
her surprise, he doesn't react...

Instead, he takes a step towards her.  She tries to ward
him off again with the flare... but he takes another
step.

                 MAGGIE
       Damn... Kalina... you better get
       over here... this shit ain't
       workin' anymore!

Maggie's panicking... and then her flare starts to go
out.

                 MAGGIE
       Hurry your ass up!

Maggie backs up... and she's hit over the head from
behind.  She lands on the floor and goes out like a
light.

Cyrus's ghost approaches the body.  And so does Kalina...

The faint flare illuminates both of them.

In Kalina's hand, we see the Arcanum.  It's obvious she
just struck Maggie with it.

Kalina removes her glasses, and looks over at Cyrus's
ghost.  He's still there, hasn't vanished.

They embrace and kiss.

And then the flare completely goes out, plunging the room
into darkness, and we...

INT. HALLWAY

85A.

Arthur and Rafkin are still walking the halls, wearing
glasses.  They're on edge, nervously looking in all
directions.  At any moment, something could jump out
of the shadows at them.

                 RAFKIN
       'There's no place like home,
       there's no place like home...'

       Knock it off.

                 ARTHUR

Rafkin spots the Hammer appear behind Arthur at the end
of the hall.  The Hammer makes eye contact with Rafkin,
and charges.

       Oh, shit.

                 RAFKIN

Before Arthur even has time to turn around, Rafkin
heroically shoves Arthur into the corner, pinning him
safely behind the shield.

Rafkin turns and faces the charging Hammer.  He's leaning
back on the glass, preventing Arthur from getting out.

                 ARTHUR
            (behind the door)
       What're you doing?!

                 RAFKIN
       Don't worry about it, Arthur...
       I've been looking for a reason
       to like myself for a long time
       now.

The Hammer approaches, but Rafkin's not running.  The
Hammer stops right in front of Rafkin.  Rafkin gulps.

The Hammer prepares to strike, when --

A TERRIFYING HOWL comes from the belly of the house.  It
gets everyone's attention, even the ghosts...

Another HOWL ECHOES through the room.  Cyrus and Kalina
watch as the 12TH SIGN lines up and CLICKS into place...
releasing the Breaker.

Kalina turns to him pissed.

                 KALINA
       You know, it's one thing for me to
       have spent all that time with that
       idiot Damon, kill him, and then
       steal his spells -- now I gotta
       babysit your stupid nephew so he
       doesn't get himself killed before
       you need him.  Enough is enough,
       Cyrus.

                 CYRUS
       But you did bring me Damon's
       spells, right?

Kalina removes the book from her bag.  She tears the
leather covering off the back of the book, and inside
is a thin reel of audio tape.

Cyrus snatches it from her, holds it up to the light, and
examines it.  Smiles when he realizes they're authentic.

                 CYRUS
       Don't you worry, Kalina, you'll

Cyrus places a reel-to-reel machine on the table.

The Hammer swings on Rafkin, who dodges the attack.  The
strike WHACKS the GLASS, sparks fly, Arthur reacts.

                 RAFKIN
            (getting cocky)
       That the best you can do?  My
       mother hits harder than that.

The Hammer's now enraged.  He swings again... and again
Rafkin dodges the strikes, bobbing and weaving, like Ali
in the ring.

                 RAFKIN
       You ain't got no speed, old man.
       What's the matter, that hammer
       weighing you down?

The Hammer's swinging wildly, but Rafkin, surprisingly,
has quicker reflexes, and it's pissing the Hammer off.

Rafkin evades another attack, and out of the corner of
his eye, he spots the Breaker turning the corner...

From his massive size, he realizes who it is.

                 RAFKIN
       Mother of Christ...

Arthur sees the Breaker approaching.  He grows larger
as he gets closer...

       you'll never get him to jump into

       Then let's give them to him...

             rope)
       Go tie them up.

       Why not?  You know as well as I do
       that human lives are the price of
       human achievement.  How many lives
       went into the construction of the

Arthur pushes the glass off him to get out, but the
Breaker slams Rafkin into the glass, which again pins
Arthur behind it.

Rafkin tries to crawl away, but the Hammer smashes him
over the back with his hammer.

Rafkin is bloody and bruised, on his last legs.

The Breaker picks Rafkin up and smashes him against the
glass door.  His broken body leaves a bloody smear as it
slides to the floor.

       Dennis!!

                 ARTHUR

Arthur sinks to his knees, crushed.  He looks up and the
ghosts are gone.  He completely falls apart...

Then suddenly, another ghost appears on the other side of
the glass.  Arthur looks up and sees --

Jean, as we saw her before, standing there, staring at
him.

Arthur looks at her, dumbstruck.

       Jean...?

                 ARTHUR

She tilts her head in response, sadness and longing in
her face.  Arthur can't hold it back anymore, a wave of
emotion rushes over him and he bursts into tears.

                 ARTHUR
       I'm so sorry... please forgive me...

She kicks the glass!  Tries holding it back, no use.  It
keeps coming.

Panic starts to set in.

The glass moves in closer.  Finally pinning her.

                 KALINA
       Oh, God... no... please...

Her face is pressed up against the glass, her breasts
flattened.  Her eyes go wide.  She starts to scream and
scream...

We start to hear the SNAPPING of RIBS.  Her arms narrower
than her body, claw uselessly at the glass.

       Aaahh...

                 KALINA

Her head, now turned sideways, is being pressed flatter
and flatter... abruptly there's a ghastly dull CLUNK as
her SKULL SPLITS and blood and brains splatter out.

The walls continue to close, crushing her body,
flattening, distending it, until there is nothing
recognizable.

them like a blade.

Arthur appears in the doorway to the great hall.  The
kids spot him.

Arthur sees their predicament.  Raises his glasses.
Along with them are the ghosts surrounding the kids,
each standing next to their symbols along the outermost
ring.

creating the combination of a meat grinder and a mixer.

The ghost raises his hand, pointing into the Ocularis,
motioning for Arthur to jump in... and that will stop
everything.

A FOURTH INNER RING FLAPS UP, working its way closer to
the center.  The kids are freaking out.

Arthur looks from his kids, to the spinning rings, and
back to Cyrus again.  He wrestles with what he should
do...

Then his eyes land on Jean.  She looks so sad, staring at

       It's the only way.  I'm sorry.
       Take care of each other...

Arthur takes a long look around at the macabre scene
before him.  First, to the ghosts that circle the Eye,
each still trapped in his or her own hell.  Then Arthur
focuses on the blades that swirl around him, threatening
to dice his family, all that he loves.  Then Arthur looks
down into the fiery mechanical purgatory that is the Eye
of Hell, its gigantic GEARS GRINDING away, the steel
bathed in crimson light, driving the house/machine toward
its fantastic culmination.

Finally to the symbols on the outer ring that flash by at
Arthur's feet.

The whole effect does something to Arthur.  Especially the
mesmerizing symbols flying by.  We suddenly INTERCUT WITH:

Arthur's fighting for his life.  He's like a wild man,
throwing everything he's got, hitting Cyrus everywhere.
In the face, the body...

                 ARTHUR
       You took away everything I loved,
       you monster.  Everything!
            (with every blow)
       Now.  I.  Want.  It.  Back!

But Arthur has never been a warrior.  Cyrus, spotting his
opportunity, retaliates.  Cyrus connects with Arthur in
the face, knocking him down.  Then he kicks Arthur in the
gut a few times, making sure he stays down.

                 CYRUS
       How dare you stand in the way of
       history, Arthur!  You are nothing,
       you hear me.  Nothing!  I
       dedicated my entire life to this.
       Every goddamn day.  When have you
       ever shown that kind of dedication?
       Huh?  To anything?!

He kicks Arthur repeatedly, like a sick mind kicking a
dog to death.

                 CYRUS
       You make me sick.

INTERCUT - CLOCKWORKS ROOM

Maggie slowly comes to, awakened from the irritating
noise of the CHANTING.  The huge gear works before her
are spinning madly now.

She notices Kalina's bloody, squashed remains in the
glass beyond.

                 MAGGIE
            (reacting to Kalina)
       Jesus...
            (rubbing her head)
       Man, what is that noise?!

Then she notices the reel-to-reel machine on the table.
Maggie reaches the machine and looks for an off switch.
Can't find one.  The CHANTING sound is unbearable.

She finally shoves the MACHINE off the table, and it goes
CRASHING to the floor.

INT. GREAT HALL

Arthur regains himself... when Cyrus appears over him.

                 CYRUS
            (out of breath)
       The world hasn't time for small
       people, Arthur.  People like you,
       or Dennis.  Or Kalina.  It needs
       those who are willing to do
       anything, without question, for
       what they believe in.

                 ARTHUR
       You sonofabitch!

Arthur rises to attack, but Cyrus stops him with a steel
sword he pulls from his cane.  He points the blade
beneath Arthur's chin.  Arthur's eyes dart around,
searching for a last way out.  Cyrus spots Arthur
thinking...

                 CYRUS
       I'm sorry, Arthur.  Unlike Jean,
       you haven't got a choice this
       time.  Now make the sacrifice.  Or
       your.  Children.  Will.  Die.

The CHANTING sound suddenly ENDS.  Silence.

Cyrus looks around in shock and confusion.  As does
Arthur.

That's when he sees Bobby's scooter come rolling behind
Cyrus from the other side of the corridor.

Arthur quickly seizes the moment and kicks Cyrus's legs,
throwing him off balance and stumbling backward, right
into the path of the scooter.

Like a banana peel, Cyrus slips on it and lands on his
ass.

Arthur scoops up the cane, as Cyrus struggles to get
back to his feet.

When Cyrus turns back around, Arthur cracks him across
the chest with the cane... sending Cyrus sailing down
the hall.  He lands at the opening of the Great Hall,
stunned by what just happened.

He glances back at the scooter, then over to where it
came.  Nothing.  He slips on his glasses for a moment,
and there standing casually in the corridor is the ghost
of Dennis Rafkin.

                 RAFKIN
       ... never bet against human
       nature, Arthur.  You'll always
       lose.

Arthur smiles in thanks.

                                CUT TO:

CYRUS

just as he comes to on the floor.  He looks up and
there's nothing there.  Arthur puts on his glasses and
sees 12 very deadly ghosts standing around Cyrus.  The
ghosts of the house reach down and grab Cyrus --

                 CYRUS
       Get away!!  No!!!!

Arthur watches as the ghosts tear into Cyrus.  It's a
feeding frenzy.  The last one in to tear in is the
Breaker.  Cyrus suffers a horrible ending.

                 CYRUS
       Let me go!  Noo!!!

He's floating in, kicking and screaming all by himself.

BACK TO SCENE

The children aren't sure what to think.  They only know
they too will join their uncle unless something happens.

Their father rushes to the door --

                 ARTHUR
            (to his kids)
       Don't look...

GHOSTS' POV

The ghosts lift Cyrus above their heads, all bloody and
broken bones, bleeding and mangled... and throw him into
the spinning gears of the Ocularis.

Maggie stands before the mad machine as it whirls out of
control.

                 MAGGIE
       Oh, sweet Lord.  What did I do?

Maggie backs toward the door.  The clockworks are
breaking apart all around her.  She tries the handle.
It's locked.

                 MAGGIE
       Mutherfucka...!

The clockworks begin flying apart.  Gears and bits of
machinery start bursting through the glass walls of the
clockworks room.

INT. GREAT HALL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

88C

The GREAT GLASS GROANS DEEPLY as the torquing of the
clockworks causes sheets of glass to fall from their
frames.

Two more rings have FLIPPED UP, the blades getting closer
to the center of the Ocularis and the kids.

GLASS begins to BREAK UP all around Arthur.  Shards of
glass rain down.  He knows he hasn't much time.

Kathy holds Bobby close, protecting him.

       Daddy!!

                 BOBBY

Arthur doesn't know what to do, but he does know that he
can't leave them there the same way he did with Jean.

                 ARTHUR
       Just hang on!  I'm coming!

Arthur backs up, and takes a running jump through the
spinning blades, just barely landing on the center island
of the Ocularis, with Kathy and Bobby.

He looks for a way off but between the glass and the
blades he knows there's no way they're getting out of
there.

Arthur holds them both tight, covering their eyes.

       Don't move!  Keep your head down!

The HOUSE starts to BLOW APART.  Glass rains down.

Arthur holds his kids tight.

The HOUSE is CRUMBLING all around them.  The only place
that's safe is where the three of them are standing.

The FURY builds to a CRESCENDO of destruction, and then
finally COLLAPSES!

Followed by silence...

Dust and smoke everywhere, blurring our vision.  As it
begins to dissipate, three figures slowly come INTO
FRAME.

Arthur, Kathy and Bobby are standing on the only
remaining section of the house left... the center island
of the Ocularis.

All around them lies what's left of the house.  A
veritable skeleton of steel.

The three of them open their eyes to survey the
destruction.

       You guys okay?

                 ARTHUR

       How did you know we'd be safe
       here?

                 ARTHUR
       I didn't.  I just wasn't about to
       leave you guys.

Kathy pulls her father into a tight hug, she's teary-
eyed.

                 KATHY
       I love you, Dad.

                 ARTHUR
       I love you, too.

As they look up, they notice Jean, standing on the outer
ring, circling around them.  She's back to looking like
her old healthy self, and she's smiling at her family.

As she passes around them again... she's gone.

Arthur pulls his kids close, and that's when they hear --

       That's it!

                 MAGGIE (O.S.)

They all turn to see Maggie crawling out of the basement
stairwell.  She's a mess, she turns to Arthur and the
kids --

                 MAGGIE
       I'm through with this nanny shit.
       This was not in the job
       description.  I'm sorry, you guys,
       but I quit... I quit.

This puts a smile on Arthur, Kathy and Bobby's faces, as
