Were underwater looking up at it. A saw cuts through, 
heading right for us. 



EXT. SNOW-CAPPED MOUNTAINS  DUSK

ICE HARVESTERS, dressed in traditional Sami clothing, score a 
frozen lake. They SING. 

The Frozen Heart (Ice Workers Song)

             ICE HARVESTERS 
      BORN OF COLD AND WINTER AIR 
      AND MOUNTAIN RAIN COMBINING, 
      THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR 
      HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING. 

The men drag giant ice blocks through channels of water. 

             ICE HARVESTERS
	(contD) 
      CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR. 
      STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR.

      SEE THE BEAUTY SHARP AND SHEER.
      SPLIT THE ICE APART!
      AND BREAK THE FROZEN HEART.  
      Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

A young Sami boy, KRISTOFF (8), and his reindeer calf, SVEN, 
share a carrot as they try to keep up with the men. 

             ICE HARVESTERS
	(contD)  
      Hup! Ho! Watch your step! Let it go!

Young Kristoff struggles to get a block of ice out of the 
water. He fails, ends up soaked. Sven licks his wet cheek.

             ICE HARVESTERS  
	(contD)  
      BEAUTIFUL! POWERFUL! DANGEROUS! COLD!
      ICE HAS A MAGIC CAN'T BE CONTROLLED.

A sharp ice floe overtakes the workers, threateningly. They 
fight it back.

             ICE HARVESTERS
	(contD) 
      STRONGER THAN ONE, STRONGER THAN TEN
      STRONGER THAN A HUNDRED MEN!

Massive fjord horses drag heavy ice plows.

             ICE HARVESTERS

      BORN OF COLD AND WINTER AIR
      AND MOUNTAIN RAIN COMBINING

The sun sets. Lanterns are lit.

             ICE HARVESTERS 
	(contD) 
      THIS ICY FORCE BOTH FOUL AND FAIR
      HAS A FROZEN HEART WORTH MINING.
      CUT THROUGH THE HEART, COLD AND CLEAR. 

In the dark, Kristoff and Sven finally manage to get a single 
block of ice out of the water.

             ICE HARVESTERS 
	(contD)  
      STRIKE FOR LOVE AND STRIKE FOR FEAR.
      THERE'S BEAUTY AND THERE'S DANGER HERE.
      SPLIT THE ICE APART!
      BEWARE THE FROZEN HEART.

The workers pile onto the giant horse-drawn ice sled as it 
pulls away. 

Left behind, Kristoff and Sven push their ice block onto a 
dinky little sled then head off. 

We sweep up from them to the Northern Lights filling the 
sky...then move across the mountains...beneath the 
snowline...and descend upon... 



EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE  NIGHT

A humble castle, built of wood, nestled in a deep fjord. 

INT. CASTLE, NURSERY NIGHT

ELSA (8) sleeps in her bed. Her little sister ANNA (5) pops 
up beside her. 

             YOUNG ANNA
      Elsa. Psst. Elsa! Psst.

Elsa doesnt stir. Anna sits on Elsa and bounces. 

             YOUNG ANNA 
	(contD)  
      Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.  

             YOUNG ELSA
        (grumbling)
      Anna, go back to sleep. 

Anna rolls onto her back and spreads all her weight on Elsa. 


  
                                         3

             YOUNG ANNA
        (drama queen-ish)
      I just cant. The skys awake, so 
      Im awake, so we have to play.  

             YOUNG ELSA
      ...Go play by yourself. 

Elsa shoves Anna off the bed. 

Anna lands butt to floor, sighs, defeated. But then she gets 
an idea. She hops back on the bed and lifts one of Elsas 
eyelids.

             YOUNG ANNA
        (mischievously)
      Do you want to build a snowman? 

Elsas eyes both pop open. She smiles.

INT. CASTLE STAIRCASE NIGHT

Anna, now wearing snow boots, pulls Elsa by the hand. 

             YOUNG ANNA
      Come on, come on, come on, come on.

Elsa tries to shush her, but Annas too excited. 

INT. BALLROOM  NIGHT

The girls sneak into the ballroom. Elsa shuts the door.

             YOUNG ANNA
      Do the magic! Do the magic! 

Elsa laughs and waves her hands together. Snowflakes suddenly 
burst forth and dance between her palms, forming a snowball. 
Elsa throws the snowball high into the air. Snow bursts out 
and flurries around the room. Anna dances about, catching 
flakes in her palms and mouth.

             YOUNG ANNA  
	(contD)   
      This is amazing!

             YOUNG ELSA
      Watch this!

Elsa stomps her little slippered foot and a layer of ice 
suddenly coats the floor, forming a giant ice rink. Anna 
slides off, laughing. 


  
PLAY MONTAGE:

                                         4

-Anna and Elsa roll giant snowballs and build a snowman 
together. Elsa moves his stick arms around.

             YOUNG ELSA 
	(contD)  
        (goofy voice)
      Hi, Im Olaf and I like warm hugs.

Anna jumps up and hugs him. 

             YOUNG ANNA
      I love you, Olaf.

-Anna and Olaf appear to be dancing. REVEAL: Elsa is actually 
propelling them across the ice floor with her magic. 

-The girls slide down snowbanks together!

-Anna fearlessly jumps off a snow peak into mid air. 

             YOUNG ANNA 
	(contD)  
      Catch me! 

Elsa makes another peak to catch Anna. 

             YOUNG ELSA
      Gotcha! 

Anna keeps jumping. Elsa keeps casting magic. 

             YOUNG ANNA
        (jumping faster)
      Again! Again!

             YOUNG ELSA
        (struggling to keep up)
      Slow down!

Elsa suddenly slips. 

Her magic accidentally STRIKES Anna in the head. Anna tumbles 
down a snowbank and lands, unconscious.

             YOUNG ELSA 
	(contD)  
      ANNA!

Elsa runs to Anna and takes her in her arms. A streak of 
Annas hair, where struck, turns white. 

             YOUNG ELSA 
	(contD)  
      MAMA! PAPA!

The room around them fills with frightening ice spikes.


  
                                         5

The parents burst through the frozen door. GASP at the sight 
of the room. 

             KING
      Elsa, what have you done? This is 
      getting out of hand!

             QUEEN
        (seeing Anna)
      Anna!

The King and Queen rush to Anna and take her in their arms.

             ELSA
      It was an accident. Im sorry, 
      Anna.

             QUEEN
        (about Anna)
      Shes ice cold.

             KING
      ...I know where we have to go.

                              SLAM CUT TO:

INT. DARK ROOM  NIGHT

The King sifts through a shelf to find an ancient book 
inscribed with Old Norse runes. He opens the book, scrambles 
to a page with an ancient map. 

EXT. ARENDELLE  NIGHT

Carrying the girls, the King and Queen ride their horses out 
of the kingdom. Snow streams from Elsas hands, leaving a 
trail of ice behind them. 

EXT. FJORD MOUNTAIN FOREST  NIGHT

A sleepy Kristoff and Sven travel alone through the dark 
woods. All of a sudden, the King and Queen race by with the 
girls, leaving the wake of ice.  

             KRISTOFF
      Ice?

                              SLAM CUT TO:


                                         6

EXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS NIGHT

Kristoff rides Sven as they follow the trail of ice.

             YOUNG KRISTOFF
      Faster, Sven!

EXT. THE VALLEY OF THE LIVING ROCK NIGHT

Kristoff hops off Sven at the edge of a deep valley. They 
hide behind a rock and peek out. 

Down below, the King holds a frightened Elsa. The Queen holds 
the still unconscious Anna. 

             KING
      Please, help. My daughter!

Suddenly, a bunch of rocks tumble down the valley toward 
them. It looks as though theyll be crushed!

But, luckily, the rocks stop at their feet. The rocks then 
unfold, revealing bright faces.

             YOUNG KRISTOFF
      Trolls...?

The rock in front of Kristoff wakes up. Meet BULDA.

             BULDA
      Shush. Im trying to listen.

She grabs Kristoff and Sven by hand and hoof and hugs them 
close. Sven licks her face and she eyes them both.

             BULDA 
	(contD)  
      Cuties. Im gonna keep you.

Back below, the crowd parts for a troll as old as the Earth. 
They call him GRAND PABBIE. He approaches arthritically, but 
determined. He nods respectfully to the king. 

             GRAND PABBIE
      Your Majesty. 
        (referring to Elsa)
      Born with the powers or cursed? 

             KING
      Born. And theyre getting stronger.

Grand Pabbie motions for the Queen to bring Anna to him. She 
does. He examines her. 


  
                                         7

             GRAND PABBIE 
        (about Anna)
      You are lucky it wasnt her heart. 
      The heart is not so easily changed, 
      but the head can be persuaded. 

             KING
      Do what you must.

             GRAND PABBIE
      I recommend we remove all magic, 
      even memories of magic to be 
      safe.... But dont worry, Ill 
      leave the fun.

Grand Pabbie pulls out a glowing blue energy from Annas 
head. We see her memories floating right above her. Grand 
Pabbie changes all of her magical memories to ordinary 
memories -- snowy play indoors with the girls in their 
nightgowns changes to outdoors on the winter fjords with the 
girls in winter gear. He puts the ordinary memories back in 
her head. 

             GRAND PABBIE 
	(contD)  
      She will be okay.  

             YOUNG ELSA
      But she wont remember I have 
      powers? 

             KING
      Its for the best. 

             PABBIE
      Listen to me, Elsa, your power will 
      only grow.

As he speaks, he conducts the Northern Lights to show a 
silhouette of an adult Elsa creating magical snowflakes. 

             PABBIE 
	(contD) 
      There is beauty in your magic.... 
      But also great danger.

The snowflakes turn to sharp spikes. 

             PABBIE
	(O.S.) 
	(contD) 
       You must learn to control it. 

In the Northern Lights display, the sharp spikes cause human 
figures to panic and attack Elsa. 

             PABBIE 
	(contD) 
      Fear will be your enemy. 


  
                                         8

Elsa gasps and buries her face in the Kings chest. The King 
wraps his arms around Elsa, protectively.  

             KING
      No. Well protect her. She can 
      learn to control it. Im sure.

Over the Kings words we...

-The Arendelle castle gates shutting. 

             KING
	(O.S.)  
	(contD) 
      Until then, well lock the gates. 
      Well reduce the staff. We will 
      limit her contact with people and 
      keep her powers hidden from 
      everyone... including Anna. 

                              DISSOLVE TO:

-The castle shutters close.

-Anna sits on her bed as Elsas furniture disappears.

-Anna rushes to the hall to see Elsa shut the door to her new 
room. Anna watches, confused and sad.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

INT. CASTLE WINDOW  DAY

We look out on a gentle snowfall. Little Anna skips up to the 
window. She lights up at the sight of the snow and rushes 
down the hall. 

INT. HALLWAY, ELSAS DOOR  DAY

Anna knocks on Elsas door and SINGS.

        Do You Want to Build a Snowman?

             YOUNG ANNA
      DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN? 
      COME ON LETS GO AND PLAY.

Anna peeks under the door. 

             YOUNG ANNA 
	(contD) 
      I NEVER SEE YOU ANYMORE. 
      COME OUT THE DOOR. 
      ITS LIKE YOUVE GONE AWAY.


  
                                         9

INT. ANNAS ROOM  Anna plays with two dolls, gives up, sad. 

             YOUNG ANNA 
	(contD) 
      WE USED TO BE BEST BUDDIES
      AND NOW WERE NOT. 
      I WISH YOU WOULD TELL ME WHY. 

-ELSAS DOOR. Anna peeks through the key hole.  

             YOUNG ANNA 
	(contD) 
      DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN? 

-Anna calls through the keyhole. 

             YOUNG ANNA 
	(contD) 
      IT DOESNT HAVE TO BE A SNOWMAN. 

             YOUNG ELSA
	(O.S.) 
      Go away, Anna.

             YOUNG ANNA
        (hearbroken)
      ...OKAY BYE. 

-BEHIND THE DOOR DAY. Elsa sits at the window looking out, 
longingly. Suddenly, her icy hands freeze the windowsill.

-LATER. The King slips leather gloves onto Elsas hands.

             KING
      The gloves will help. 

He pats her gloved hand. 

             KING 
	(contD) 
      See? Youre good.... 
        (starting their mantra)
      Conceal it. 

             YOUNG ELSA
      Dont feel it.

             YOUNG ELSA & KING 
      Dont let it show.

INT. HALLWAY, ELSAS DOOR  DAY. Anna, now 9, knocks on 
Elsas door.

             ANNA
	(9)
      DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN? 

INT. HALLWAY  DAY. Alone, Anna rides a bicycle built for 
two in the hall by standing on the back seat. 


  
                                         10

             ANNA
	(9) 
	(contD) 
      OR RIDE OUR BIKE AROUND THE HALL?
      I THINK SOME COMPANY IS OVERDUE...

INT. PORTRAIT ROOM  DAY. Anna runs around the portrait 
room, gaining momentum to flip over the arm of the couch.

             ANNA
	(9) 
	(contD) 
      IVE STARTED TALKING TO 
      THE PICTURES ON THE WALLS.

Anna lands PLOP on the cushions, then looks up at the 
painting above her of the courageous Joan of Arc. 

             ANNA	
	(9) 
	(contD) 
      Hang in there, Joan. 

INT. EMPTY LIBRARY  DAY. Looks like no ones around.

             ANNA
	(9) 
	(contD) 
      IT GETS A LITTLE LONELY
      ALL THESE EMPTY ROOMS. 

But then we find Anna, laying at the base of the grandfather 
clock, playing with her braids, bored out of her mind.  

             ANNA
	(9) 
	(contD) 
      JUST WATCHING THE HOURS TICK BY. 

Annas eyes follow the grandfather clocks pendulum. 

             ANNA
	(9) 
	(contD) 
      TICK TOCK. TICK TOCK. TICK TOCK.

INT. ELSAS ROOM  NIGHT. Elsa (now 12) paces as she panics. 
The entire wall is frozen behind her. 

             ELSA
	(12)
      Im scared. Its getting stronger. 

             KING
      Getting upset only makes it worse.

The King goes to hug her. 

             ELSA
	(12)
      No. Dont touch me. I dont want to 
      hurt you.

He and the Queen look at each other with alarmed sadness. 

INT. LIBRARY  DAY. Anna, now a teenager, slides past Elsas 
room without stopping.

parents, formally, not touching them.

             KING
      Youll be fine, Elsa.

EXT. DOCKS  DAY. The King and Queen leave on a ship. 

EXT. ROUGH SEAS  NIGHT. Lightning flashes. The sea rages in 
a storm. The King and Queens ship is lost in the waves. 

INT. CASTLE  DAY. A portrait of the King and Queen is 
covered in mourning cloth.

EXT. CEMETERY  DAY. Anna looks small, standing before her 
people, beside burial stones. 

INT. HALLWAY, ELSAS DOOR. Anna, still in her mourning 
clothes, approaches and knocks. 

             ANNA
        (singing)
      Elsa? PLEASE I KNOW YOURE IN THERE
      PEOPLE ARE ASKING WHERE YOUVE BEEN
      THEY SAY HAVE COURAGE 
      AND IM TRYING TO
      IM RIGHT OUT HERE FOR YOU.
      PLEASE LET ME IN. 

Anna slides down the door and sits with her head against it. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      WE ONLY HAVE EACH OTHER. 
      ITS JUST YOU AND ME. 
      WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO? 
        (weak, internal)
      DO YOU WANT TO BUILD A SNOWMAN?

We move through the door...

INT. ELSAS ROOM  DAY. Elsa is sitting in the exact same 
pose as Anna. Her bedroom is frozen with ice. Snowflakes hang 
in the air, suspended by grief.  

                                FADE OUT.


  
                                         12

EXT. THE KINGDOM OF ARENDELLE  MORNING

A new dawn rises over the fjords. 

Ships pull up to the docks. Guests pile out. 

             DOCK MASTER
      Welcome to Arendelle!

A BOY tries to get away as his MOTHER tries to stuff him in 
his bunad jacket. 

             BOY
      Why do I have to wear this? 

             MOTHER
      Because the Queen has come of age. 
      Its Coronation Day!

             BOY
      Thats not my fault. 

They pass the May Pole being raised and a Sami ice harvester 
chatting with his reindeer. We recognize them as Kristoff and 
Sven, all grown up. Sven hops around excitedly like a dog and 
nuzzles Kristoffs chest.

             KRISTOFF
      What do you want, Sven?

Kristoff leans in and speaks for Sven, as if he can. 

             KRISTOFF
	(AS SVEN) 
	(contD) 
      Give me a snack.

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      Whats the magic word?

             KRISTOFF
	(AS SVEN) 
	(contD) 
      Please!

Kristoff pulls a carrot out of his shirt pocket and hands it 
to Sven. Sven tries to bite the whole thing. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      Hey, hey, hey! Share!

Sven takes a smaller bite. Kristoff then has a bite himself, 
not seeming to care that its covered in reindeer slobber. 

We move on to PERSI and AGGIE, a super-excited couple who 
rush towards the castle.


  
                                         13

             PERSI
      I cant believe theyre finally 
      opening up the gates!

             AGGIE
      And for a whole day! Faster, Persi!

They pass a tiny but menacing DUKE, who wears taps on his 
shoes to enhance his presence. Two THUG guards follow close 
behind him. 

             DUKE
      Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious 
      trade partner. Open those gates so 
      I may unlock your secrets and 
      exploit your riches.
        (catching himself)
      ...Did I just say that out loud? 

We leave him and head down the bridge towards the castle 
gates, passing an Irishman and a Spanish Dignitary.  

             IRISHMAN
      Oh, me sore eyes cant wait to see 
      the Queen and the Princess. I bet 
      theyre absolutely lovely.

             SPANISH DIGNITARY
      I bet they are beautiful. 

We move past them, to a particular castle window. 

                                  CUT TO:

INT. CASTLE, ANNAS BEDROOM  DAY

Anna, 18, snores. Drools. KNOCK. KNOCK.

             KAI
	(O.S.) 
      Princess Anna...?  

Anna sits up. Shes got major bedhead. She coughs. Snorts. 
Pulls a hair from her mouth. 

             ANNA
      ...Huh? Yeah? 

             KAI
	(O.S.) 
      Sorry to wake you, maam but--  

             ANNA
      No, you didnt. Ive been up for 
      hours.  


  
                                         14

She falls back asleep while sitting. She snores. Her head 
drops, startling her awake. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      Who is it? 

             KAI
	(O.S.) 
      Its still me, maam. Time to get 
      ready.

             ANNA
      Ready for what? 

             KAI
	(O.S.) 
      Your sisters coronation, maam.

             ANNA
      My sisters cor-neration... 

One eye opens enough to catch sight of her coronation dress. 
She bolts, wide awake in excitement. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      Coronation Day! Ha ha!

                              SLAM CUT TO:

EXT. CASTLE HALL  DAY

Anna bursts out of her room, wearing her coronation dress. 
She finishes pinning ribbons in her hair. Seeing the hustle 
and bustle of preparations, she cant help but SING.

For the First Time in Forever

             ANNA
      THE WINDOW IS OPEN!
      SO'S THAT DOOR!
      I DIDN'T KNOW THEY DID THAT ANYMORE.
      WHO KNEW WE OWNED 8000 SALAD PLATES...?

-Anna slides along the floor of the ballroom in her socks. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      FOR YEARS I HAVE ROAMED THESE EMPTY HALLS
      WHY HAVE A BALLROOM WITH NO BALLS?
      FINALLY, THEY'RE OPENING UP THE GATES! 

-She shakes hands with a suit of armor. Breaks it. Hides the 
evidence. 


  
                                         15

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      THERE'LL BE REAL, ACTUAL PEOPLE -
      IT'LL BE TOTALLY STRANGE.
      BUT WOW AM I SO READY FOR THIS CHANGE!

-Anna comes to a window and jumps out onto a window washers 
pulley. She raises herself up to see the ships arriving.

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
      THERE'LL BE MUSIC, THERE'LL BE LIGHT.
      FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
      I'LL BE DANCING THROUGH THE NIGHT.

-Anna walks through the garden and follows a family of geese.

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      DON'T KNOW IF I'M ELATED OR GASSY,
      BUT I'M SOMEWHERE IN THAT ZONE
      'CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
      I WON'T BE ALONE.
        (speaking)
      I cant wait to meet everyone....
      (GASP) What if I meet THE ONE?

-Anna twists herself in a velvet drape like its a gown. She 
acts like she looks gorgeous, but she looks ridiculous. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      TONIGHT, IMAGINE ME GOWN AND ALL-
      FETCHINGLY DRAPED AGAINST THE WALL.
      THE PICTURE OF SOPHISTICATED GRACE.

-She notices the bust of a man across the room.

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
        (google-eyed)
      I SUDDENLY SEE HIM STANDING THERE,
      A BEAUTIFUL STRANGER TALL AND FAIR.
        (mouth full of chocolate)
      I WANNA STUFF SOME CHOCOLATE IN MY 
      FACE!

-She grabs the bust of the man and swings it around. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      BUT THEN WE LAUGH AND TALK ALL EVENING,
      WHICH IS TOTALLY BIZARRE.
      NOTHING LIKE THE LIFE I'VE LED SO FAR.

The bust goes flying and lands on the top of the cake. 

-Anna bursts into the portrait room, bounces on the 
furniture, and interacts with the paintings.

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
      THERE'LL BE MAGIC, THERE'LL BE FUN.
      FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
      I COULD BE NOTICED BY SOMEONE.
      AND I KNOW IT IS TOTALLY CRAZY
      TO DREAM I'D FIND ROMANCE.
      BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
      AT LEAST I'VE GOT A CHANCE!

INT. LIBRARY. ELSA, now a very poised 21, watches out the 
window as the coronation guests arrive. 

             ELSA
      DON'T LET THEM IN. 
      DON'T LET THEM SEE.
      BE THE GOOD GIRL
      YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO BE.

Elsa moves to a painting of her fathers coronation. She 
takes off her gloves and mimics the painting by holding a 
candlestick and ornament in place of an orb and scepter. 

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      CONCEAL. DON'T FEEL.
      PUT ON A SHOW. 
      MAKE ONE WRONG MOVE
      AND EVERYONE WILL KNOW.

The candlestick and ornament ice over. Elsa gasps, slams them 
back down onto the table. She tries to reassure herself. 

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      BUT IT'S ONLY FOR TODAY. 

We cut between Annas excitement and Elsas nerves.

             ANNA
      IT'S ONLY FOR TODAY!

             ELSA
      IT'S AGONY TO WAIT.

             ANNA
      IT'S AGONY TO WAIT!!!

             ELSA
      TELL THE GUARDS TO OPEN UP THE GATE.

             ANNA
      THE GATE!!!

-Finally, the gates are open! Anna moves through the crowd, 
admiring the people around her.

      		ANNA
	I'M GETTING WHAT I'M DREAMING 
	OF

	WORLD
	A CHANCE TO FIND TRUE LOVE

	CONCEAL.
	CONCEAL. DON'T FEEL. 
	DON'T LET THEM KNOW.

-Anna hurries over the bridge and into the village square. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      I KNOW IT ALL ENDS TOMORROW,
      SO IT HAS TO BE TODAY!!
      CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
      FOREVER. . .
      FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER!
      NOTHING'S IN MY WAY!!!

-Anna SLAMS right into the breast of a HORSE!

She falls back and lands in a small wooden boat. It tips off 
of the dock. Shes heading overboard. But just then, the 
horse slams his hoof into the boat and steadies it. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
        (frustrated)
      Hey!

             HANS 
      Im so sorry. Are you hurt? 

The rider, HANS, sure is handsome and regal. 

             ANNA
        (gentler)
      Hey. I-ya, no. No. Im okay.

             HANS
      Are you sure? 

             ANNA
      Yeah, I just wasnt looking where I 
      was going. But Im okay.

He hops down from his horse and steps into the boat. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      Im great, actually.


  
                                         18

             HANS
      Oh, thank goodness. 

He offers her a hand and their eyes meet. Chemistry. He helps 
her to her feet. 

             HANS 
	(contD) 
        (bowing)
      Prince Hans of the Southern Isles. 

             ANNA
        (curtseying)
      Princess Anna of Arendelle. 

             HANS
      Princess...? My Lady. 

He drops to his knees, head bowed. The horse bows too, 
curling his hoof up and out of the boat. 

The boat tips. Hans tumbles on top of Anna. Awkward.

             ANNA
      Hi...again.

The horse slams his foot back into the boat to stabilize it. 
Anna and Hans tumble the other way. Anna lands on top of him. 

             HANS
      Oh boy.

             ANNA
      Ha. This is awkward. Not youre 
      awkward, but just because were-- 
      Im awkward. Youre gorgeous. 
        (did she just say that?)
      Wait, what? 

Hans quickly gets to his feet and helps Anna up again.

             HANS
      Id like to formally apologize for 
      hitting the Princess of Arendelle 
      with my horse...and for every 
      moment after. 

             ANNA
      No. No-no. Its fine. Im not THAT 
      Princess. I mean, if youd hit my 
      sister Elsa, that would be-- yeash! 
      Cuz, you know...
        (patting the horse)
      Hello.

             ANNA
	(cont'd)
        (to Hans)
      But, lucky you, its-its just me. 

             HANS
      Just you? 

Hans smiles, amused. She smiles back. The bells RING. She 
doesnt notice at first; shes too busy drinking in Hanss 
handsomeness. 

             ANNA
      ...The bells. The coronation. I-I-I 
      better go. I have to...I better go.

She hurries off, stops, turns back. Gives Hans a little wave.

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      Bye!

As she rushes off again, Hans waves back. The horse waves 
too, once again taking his hoof out of the boat. 

             HANS
      Oh no. 

The boat falls, with Hans in it. SPLASH! It lands upside down 
in the water. Hans raises it up off of him, gasping for air. 

                                  CUT TO:

INT. CHURCH CHAPEL  DAY

Elsa stands at the alter. Anna stands off to one side. She 
peeks out to the audience.

Hans waves at her from the pews. Hes changed his clothes.

The crown is placed on Elsas head. The scepter and orb are 
presented to Elsa on a pillow. She slowly reaches for them. 

             BISHOP
        (a whisper)
      Your Majesty, the gloves.

Elsa hesitates. She breathes nervously, removes her gloves, 
places them on the pillow. Her hands shake. She takes the orb 
and scepter, then turns to the people.

             BISHOP 
	(contD) 
        (formal, in Old Norse)
      Sehm hon HELL-drr IN-um HELL-gum 
      AYG-num ok krund ee THES-um HELL-

      thear...


  
                                         20

The scepter and orb start to freeze over.

             BISHOP 
	(contD) 
      ...Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

             CROWD
      Queen Elsa of Arendelle. 

Just in time. Elsa manages to set the orb and scepter back 
down on the pillow before anyone notices the ice. She picks 
up her gloves and slips them on. She made it.  

                                  CUT TO:

INT. GREAT HALL  NIGHT

Springy music fills the Great Hall. Guests dance. Eat. Laugh.

TRUMPETS SOUND.

             KAI
        (announcing)
      Queen Elsa of Arendelle. 

Elsa enters, poised and looking surprisingly content. She 
stands under a formal awning. 

             KAI 
	(contD) 
      Princess Anna of Arendelle! 

Anna runs into the room, waves awkwardly. Kai ushers her over 
to stand right next to Elsa.  

             ANNA
      Here? Are you sure?

She and Elsa sneak awkward peeks at each other.  

             ELSA
      ...Hi. 

             ANNA
      Hi me...? Oh. Um. Hi. 

             ELSA
      ...You look beautiful.  

             ANNA
      Thank you. You look beautifuller. I 
      mean, not fuller. You dont look 
      fuller, but more beautiful. 


  
                                         21

             ELSA
      Thank you.  

They look out at the celebration. 

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      So, this is what a party looks 
      like? 

             ANNA
      Its warmer than I thought. 

             ELSA
      And what is that amazing smell? 

They both close their eyes and inhale. 

             ANNA AND ELSA
	(TOGETHER)
      ...Chocolate. 

Their eyes pop open. They laugh. 

Elsa looks back out at the party. Anna looks at Elsa. She 
wants to say so much, but she cant think of where to start. 
Just as she finds her way, Kai interrupts. 

             KAI
      Your Majesty. The Duke of 
      Weaseltown.

             DUKE
      Weselton. The Duke of Weselton. 
        (to Elsa)
      Your Majesty, as your closest 
      partner in trade, it seems only 
      fitting that I offer you your first 
      dance as queen. 

The Duke does a funny flitter of his feet, a hitch-kick, and 
a deep bow. 

             DUKE 
	(contD) 
        (whispers to himself)
      One, two, three. Jump.

As he holds out his hand, head down, his toupee dips forward.  
Anna giggles. Elsa looks at Anna, stifles a giggle herself. 

             ELSA
        (to the Duke)
      Thank you...only I dont dance. 


  
                                         22

             DUKE
        (offended)
      Oh...? 

             ELSA
      But my sister does. 

             ANNA
      What?

             DUKE
      Lucky you.... 

             ANNA
      Oh, I dont think--

The Duke grabs Annas arm and yanks her away before she can 
protest.

             DUKE
      If you swoon, let me know, Ill 
      catch you.

Anna looks back at Elsa, desperately. 

             ELSA
      Sorry.

OUT ON THE DANCE FLOOR: The Duke showboats, but hes just 
awful. Anna tries to make the best of it. 

             DUKE
      Like an agile peacock... CLUCK-
      CLUGGLE-CLUCK!

He lands on her feet.

             ANNA
      Ow. Ow.

             DUKE
      Speaking of, so great to have the 
      gates open. Why did they shut them 
      in the first place? Do you know the 
      reason? Hmm?

He gets in her face, suspicious. 

             ANNA
      ...No.


  
                                         23

             DUKE
      Oh, all right. Hang on. They dont 
      call me the little dipper for 
      nothing.

He dips Anna back. Elsa peeks through the crowd, can barely 
hold in her laughter. Anna shoots Elsa funny, help-me looks. 

             DUKE 
	(contD) 
        (groove fully on)
      Like a chicken...with the face of a 
      monkey...I fly.

                              JUMP CUT TO:

MOMENTS LATER...

Anna limps back to Elsa. 

             DUKE
	(O.S.)
      Let me know when youre ready for 
      another round, MLady. 

             ELSA
      Well, he was sprightly. 

             ANNA
        (rubbing her sore feet)
      Especially for a man in heels. 

             ELSA
      Are you okay? 

             ANNA
        (loving Elsas attention)
      Ive never been better. This is so 
      nice. I wish it could be like this 
      all the time. 

             ELSA
        (sincere)
      Me too....

But then Elsa catches herself. She stiffens up, looks away. 

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      But it cant. 

             ANNA
      Why not? If--

             ELSA
      It just cant. 


  
                                         24

Annas smile drops. She tries not to get emotional. 

             ANNA
      Excuse me for a minute. 

She walks away. Elsa watches her go, saddened. 

Moving through the crowd, Anna gets bumped by a bowing mans 
butt. She falls. Just before she hits the floor, Hans catches 
her. He smiles perfectly. 

             HANS
      Glad I caught you.

             ANNA
      Hans.

He smoothly sets his drink down on a passing tray. He lifts 
her up and leads her in a romantic dance.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

LATER: Anna and Hans drink and chat. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      I often had the whole parlor to 
      myself to slide... Oops. Sorry.

She hits him in the face by mistake with her hand. He laughs.

-THE CASTLE DOORS: Anna and Hans stroll out of the castle. 

                              DISSOLVE TO:

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      ...Your physique helps Im sure.

-THE ROSE GARDEN... Hans notices her white streak. 

                              DISSOLVE TO:

             HANS
        (about her white streak)
      Whats this?

             ANNA
      I was born with it, although I 
      dreamt I was kissed by a troll. 

             HANS
      I like it.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BALCONY  NIGHT

Anna teaches Hans how to eat krumkake.

             ANNA 
      Yeah, the whole thing! You got it.

They laugh as the krumkake crumbles in his face.

             ANNA
	(contD) 
      Okay wait, wait. So you have how 
      many brothers?

             HANS
      Twelve older brothers. Three of 
      them pretended I was invisible... 
      literally...for two years.

             ANNA
      Thats horrible.  

             HANS
      Its what brothers do. 

             ANNA
      ...And sisters. Elsa and I were 
      really close when we were little. 
      But then, one day she just shut me 
      out, and I never knew why.  

He takes her hand. Leans in close. 

             HANS
      I would never shut you out. 

             ANNA
      Okay, can I just say something 
      crazy?

             HANS
      I love crazy.

"Love is an Open Door

      ALL MY LIFE HAS BEEN A SERIES OF 
      DOORS IN MY FACE.
      AND THEN SUDDENLY I BUMP INTO YOU.

             HANS
      I was thinking the same thing, 
      because like. . .

             HANS
	(cont'd)
      I'VE BEEN SEARCHING MY WHOLE LIFE 
      TO FIND MY OWN PLACE.
      AND MAYBE IT'S THE PARTY TALKING, 
      OR THE CHOCOLATE FONDUE. 

             ANNA
      BUT WITH YOU-

             HANS
      BUT WITH YOU,
      I FOUND MY PLACE.

             ANNA
      I SEE YOUR FACE.

             BOTH
      AND IT'S NOTHING LIKE I'VE EVER 
      KNOWN BEFORE.

They jump to the neighboring balcony and enter a door. 

They come out on top of one of the castles towers.

             BOTH 
	(contD) 
      LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR!
      LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR! 

Cut to them sliding across an empty hallway in their socks.

             BOTH 
	(contD) 
      LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR

            ANNA
      WITH YOU!

             HANS
      WITH YOU!

             ANNA
      WITH YOU!

             HANS
      WITH YOU!

             BOTH
      LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR.

They hop up on the castle roof and watch a shooting star.

             HANS
      I MEAN IT'S CRAZY. 

             ANNA
      What?  

                                         27

             HANS
      WE FINISH EACH OTHER'S-

             ANNA
      SANDWICHES!

             HANS
      That's what I was gonna say!

They slide down the back of the roof out of sight. 

We next find them strutting on a bridge ledge.

             ANNA
      I'VE NEVER MET SOMEONE-

             BOTH
      WHO THINKS SO MUCH LIKE ME.

             BOTH
	(SPOKEN) 
	(contD) 
      Jinx.. . .jinx again.

Are they doing the robot? No. Theyre imitating the 
mechanical figures on the clock tower. 

             BOTH 
	(contD) 
      OUR MENTAL SYNCHRONIZATION
      CAN HAVE BUT ONE EXPLANATION,

             HANS
      YOU-

             ANNA
      AND I-

             HANS
      WERE-

             ANNA
      JUST-

             BOTH
      MEANT TO BE.

Anna and Hans dance on top of the lighthouse and cast dancing 
shadows across the sails of ships in the docks. 

             ANNA
      SAY GOODBYE-

             HANS
      SAY GOODBYE- 


  
                                         28

             BOTH
      TO THE PAIN OF THE PAST.

             BOTH 
	(contD) 
      WE DON'T HAVE TO FEEL IT ANYMORE!
      LOVE IS AN OPEN-

They play hide and seek amongst the stable doors.

             BOTH 
	(contD) 
      DOOR! LOVE IS AN OPEN DOOR!

They climb to the waterfall looking out over the kingdom.

Anna raises up her hands to frame the moon. Hans puts his 
hands on top of hers. Together their hands form a  heart. 

             BOTH 
	(contD) 
      LIFE CAN BE SO MUCH MORE-

             ANNA
      WITH YOU!

             HANS
      WITH YOU!

             ANNA

             HANS

      LOVE IS AN OPEN 

             HANS
      DOOR.

             ANNA
      DOOR.

             HANS
      Can I say something crazy...? Will 
      you marry me?

             ANNA
      Can I just say something even 
      crazier? Yes.

INT. BALL  NIGHT 

                                         29

Anna pushes through the crowd towards Elsa, Hans in tow.   

             ANNA
      Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we just 
      get around you there? Thank you. 
      Oh, there she is. Elsa! 

Elsa turns to Anna. Anna curtseys awkwardly. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      I mean...Queen.... Me again. Um. 
      May I present Prince Hans of the 
      Southern Isles. 

             HANS
        (bowing)
      Your Majesty.

Elsa gives a polite but reserved curtsey.

             ANNA
      We would like--

             HANS
      --your blessing--

             ANNA
      --of--

             ANNA/HANS
      --our marriage!

             ELSA
      Marriage...? 

             ANNA
      Yes!

             ELSA
      Im sorry, Im confused.  

             ANNA
      Well, we havent worked out all the 
      details ourselves. Well need a few 
      days to plan the ceremony. Of 
      course well have soup, roast, and 
      ice cream and then--
      Wait. Would we live here? 

             ELSA
      Here? 


  
                                         30

             HANS
      Absolutely!  

             ELSA
      Anna-- 

             ANNA
      Oh, we can invite all twelve of 
      your brothers to stay with us--

             ELSA
      What? No, no, no, no, no.

             ANNA
      Of course we have the room. I dont 
      know. Some of them must-- 

             ELSA
      Wait. Slow down. No ones brothers 
      are staying here. No one is getting 
      married. 

             ANNA
      Wait, what? 

             ELSA
      May I talk to you, please. Alone. 

Anna sees Hanss worried face. Hooks arms with him. 

             ANNA
      No. Whatever you have to say, you-
      you can say to both of us. 

             ELSA
      Fine. You cant marry a man you 
      just met.    

             ANNA
      You can if its true love. 

             ELSA
      Anna, what do you know about true 
      love? 

             ANNA
      More than you. All you know is how 
      to shut people out.   

             ELSA
      You asked for my blessing, but my 
      answer is no. Now, excuse me.


  
                                         31

             HANS
      Your Majesty, if I may ease your--

             ELSA
        (flustered)
      No, you may not. And I-I think you 
      should go. 

Elsa walks away. As she passes the Royal Handler--

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      The party is over. Close the gates. 

             ANNA
      What? Elsa, no. No, wait!

Anna grabs Elsas hand. She pulls off Elsas glove. Elsa 
gasps, spins around and reaches for the glove in panic. 

             ELSA
      Give me my glove!

Anna holds the glove away from Elsa. 

             ANNA
        (desperate)
      Elsa, please. Please. I cant live 
      like this anymore.   

Elsa fights tears. 

             ELSA
        (weak)
      ...Then leave. 

Elsa sees Annas hurt face. Its too much. She cant hold it 
in. She turns and rushes away. 

             ANNA
        (heartbroken)
      ...What did I ever do to you?! 

The party goes silent as everyone watches the sisters. 

             ELSA
      Enough, Anna.

             ANNA
      No. Why? Why do you shut me out?! 
      Why do you shut the world out?! 
      What are you so afraid of?! 

             ELSA
      I said, enough!


  
                                         32

Ice shoots from Elsas hand, spikes across the floor! Guests 
cry out in shock, back away.

             DUKE
        (ducking behind his men)
      ...Sorcery. I knew there was 
      something dubious going on here. 

             ANNA
      Elsa...?

Elsa rushes out of the room. 

                                  CUT TO:

EXT. COURTYARD  NIGHT

Elsa bursts out of the castle door. The CITIZENS CHEER! 

             CROWD
      There she is. Your Majesty! Long 
      live the Queen! Queen Elsa.... Come 
      drink with us. 

Elsa ducks through the crowd, holding her bare hand. 

             BOWING TOWNSMAN
      Queen Elsa.

             TOWNSWOMAN WITH BABY
      Your Majesty? Are you all right?

Elsa backs away from the baby. She knocks into the fountain, 
grabs its edge. The waters freeze at her touch. 

GASPS of shock and fear sweep over the crowd. 

The Duke and thugs come out the door.

             DUKE
      There she is! Stop her!

             ELSA
        (to the Duke)
      Please, just stay away from me. 
      Stay away!

Magic accidentally shoots from her hand and turns the 
staircase into ice. The thugs and the Duke fall. 

             DUKE
      Monster.... Monster!


  
                                         33

The crowd panics. 

A snowstorm begins. Elsa flees. 

Anna runs out of the palace doors, carrying the glove. 

             ANNA
      Elsa!

Hans follows closely behind her.

GATES TO THE KINGDOM: Elsa runs out of the gates and down to 
the waters edge. The shoreline freezes under her feet. 

Anna calls to her from the gates. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      Elsa! Wait, please!

Elsa glances back at Anna, but turns away. She tentatively 
steps out onto the fjord. It freezes instantly. She breaks 
into a run, as the water freezes over with each step. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      Elsa, stop!

Anna rushes out onto the fjord ice, slips, falls. 

             HANS
      Anna! 

Hans rushes to Annas side. 

Elsa reaches the far shore. She doesnt look back. She just 
scrambles into the mountains. 

             ANNA
      No. 

             HANS
        (shocked)
      Look.... The fjord.

The ice spreads out until the entire fjord is frozen, locking 
the ships in place. 

INT. CASTLE COURTYARD  NIGHT 

Snow falls. Hans and Anna move through the panicking crowd. 

             CROWD WALLAH
      Snow? Its...snow...in July.


  
                                         34

             HANS
      ...Are you all right? 

             ANNA
        (in shock)
      No. 

             HANS
      Did you know? 

             ANNA
      No. 

Nearby, the Duke flutters about in fright.

             DUKE
      Look! Its snowing! Its snowing! 
      The Queen has cursed this land! She 
      must be stopped! 
        (to his thugs)
      You have to go after her. 

Anna rushes up to the Duke. 

             ANNA
      Wait, no! 

The Duke hides behind his thugs and points out at Anna. 

             DUKE
      You! Is there sorcery in you, too? 
      Are you a monster, too?   

             ANNA
      No. No. Im completely ordinary. 

             HANS
      Thats right she is...
        (realizing how that 
         sounds)
      ...in the best way.

             ANNA
      ...And my sisters not a monster.  

             DUKE
      She nearly killed me. 

             HANS
      You slipped on ice. 

             DUKE
      Her ice!


  
                                         35

             ANNA
      It was an accident. She was scared. 
      She didnt mean it. She didnt mean 
      any of this.... Tonight was my 
      fault. I pushed her. So Im the one 
      that needs to go after her. 

             DUKE
      Yes. Fine. Do.

             HANS
      What?

             ANNA
        (to the Royal Handler)
      Bring me my horse, please. 

             HANS
      Anna, no. Its too dangerous. 

             ANNA
      Elsas not dangerous. Ill bring 
      her back, and Ill make this right. 

The Royal Handler brings Anna her horse and a cloak. 

             HANS
      Im coming with you.  

             ANNA
      No, I need you here to take care of 
      Arendelle. 

He sees the desperation in her eyes.

             HANS
      ...On my honor.

She throws on the cloak and hops right onto the horse, 
coronation dress and all. 

             ANNA
        (to the crowd)
      I leave Prince Hans in charge!  

             HANS
        (before letting her go)
      Are you sure you can trust her? I 
      dont want you getting hurt. 

             ANNA
      Shes my sister; she would never 
      hurt me. 


  
                                         36

She snaps the reins and rides out. Hans watches after her. 

The snow picks up and overtakes our view. We push through a 
blizzard...lose our way...then finds ourselves...

EXT. HIGH UP IN THE MOUNTAINS  NIGHT

Well above the snow-line, a small figure climbs the highest 
peak. Its Elsa. Finally, she stops, looks around. Catches 
her breath and sings... 

"Let It Go

             ELSA
      THE SNOW GLOWS WHITE
      ON THE MOUNTAIN TONIGHT,
      NOT A FOOTPRINT TO BE SEEN.
      A KINGDOM OF ISOLATION 
      AND IT LOOKS LIKE I'M THE QUEEN.

      THE WIND IS HOWLING
      LIKE THIS SWIRLING STORM INSIDE.
      COULDN'T KEEP IT IN,
      HEAVEN KNOWS I TRIED. . .

      DON'T LET THEM IN,
      DON'T LET THEM SEE,
      BE THE GOOD GIRL YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO 
      BE.
      CONCEAL,
      DON'T FEEL,
      DON'T LET THEM KNOW. 
      WELL, NOW THEY KNOW.

Elsa takes off her glove and throws it into the air. 

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      LET IT GO. LET IT GO.
      CAN'T HOLD IT BACK ANYMORE.

Elsa creates a snowman, just like the one she made with Anna 
when they were children.

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      LET IT GO. LET IT GO.
      TURN AWAY AND SLAM THE DOOR.
      I DON'T CARE WHAT THEYRE GOING TO  
      SAY.
      LET THE STORM RAGE ON.
      THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.

Elsa lets her cape fly back into the wind. 


  
                                         37

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      IT'S FUNNY HOW SOME DISTANCE
      MAKES EVERYTHING SEEM SMALL.
      AND THE FEARS THAT ONCE CONTROLLED ME
      CAN'T GET TO ME AT ALL.
      IT'S TIME TO SEE 
      WHAT I CAN DO,
      TO TEST THE LIMITS AND BREAK THROUGH.
      NO RIGHT, NO WRONG,
      NO RULES FOR ME...I'M FREE!

Elsa creates ice steps and climbs them. 

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
      I AM ONE WITH THE WIND AND SKY.
      LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
      YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME CRY.
      HERE I STAND AND HERE I'LL STAY.

Elsa slams her foot down and forms a giant snowflake. 

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      LET THE STORM RAGE ON....

In a flurry of creative release, she raises the snowflake on 
ice beams, builds walls, archways, a glistening chandelier, 
and an intricate ceiling that leaves the sky visible. 

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      MY POWER FLURRIES THROUGH THE AIR 
      INTO THE GROUND.
      MY SOUL IS SPIRALING IN FROZEN 
      FRACTALS ALL AROUND.
      AND ONE THOUGHT CRYSTALLIZES LIKE 
      AN ICY BLAST-

Standing firmly in her mighty ice palace, Elsa removes her 
crown and throws it. 

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      I'M NEVER GOING BACK,  
      (back to resolve) 
      THE PAST IS IN THE PAST!

She takes down her hair and creates a new dress made of ice.

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      LET IT GO! LET IT GO!
      AND I'LL RISE LIKE THE BREAK OF DAWN.
      LET IT GO! LET IT GO!

The sun rises. Elsa struts onto out onto a balcony and into 
the light. Shes free.


  
                                         38

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      THAT PERFECT GIRL IS GONE.
      HERE I STAND IN THE LIGHT OF DAY.
      LET THE STORM RAGE ON!!
      THE COLD NEVER BOTHERED ME ANYWAY.

She turns and slams her ice palace door on us. 

EXT. THE FJORD FOREST  DAY

Anna rides her horse through two feet of snow. She shivers. 

                                  CUT TO:

             ANNA
        (shivering)
      Elsa! Elsa! Its me, Anna...your 
      sister who didnt mean to make you 
      freeze the summer. Im sorry. Its 
      all my f-f-f-f-f-f-fault. 

LATER: Anna and the horse struggle through a wooded area. 

                              DISSOLVE TO:

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
        (hearing a wolf howl)
      Of course, none of this would have 
      happened if shed just told me her 
      secret...ha...shes a stinker.

A branch of a nearby tree snaps and startles the horse. Anna 
goes flying off, lands face down in the snow. She sits up. 
Spits out snow. Sees the horse running away. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      Oh no. No. No. No. Come back. No. 
      No. No. No.... Oooo-kay. 

He doesnt come back. Anna grabs onto a branch of a leaning 
conifer, tries to pull herself to her feet, but the tree 
snaps upright and releases all its snow onto her. GROAN.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. MOUNTAIN NIGHT 

The Northern Lights shine as Anna struggles, out of breath, 
reaching the top of a hill. 


  
                                         39

             ANNA
      Snow, it had to be snow, she 
      couldnt have had tr-tr-tropical 
      magic that covered the f-f-fjords 
      in white sand and warm --

She sees smoke rising up in the distance. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      Fire! WHOA!

Anna goes tumbling down the hill. She lands with a crash in 
an icy stream at the bottom.  

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
        (from inside the snowball)
      Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold...    

EXT. A SMALL BUILDING AND STABLE NIGHT

Anna shuffles up to the building, her dress frozen stiff. She 
shakes the snow off a sign and reads:

             ANNA
      Wandering Oakens Trading Post.

Snow drops off a smaller sign. She reads it, happily.

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      Ooh! And Sauna... 

INT. WANDERING OAKENS TRADING POST & SAUNA  NIGHT

Anna steps cautiously through the door--which hits her frozen 
butt and knocks her into the center of the shop. She looks 
around, sees only summer supplies. 

             OAKEN
	(O.S.) 
      Hoo hoo.

Anna turns to see a bright-faced fellow sitting low behind 
the counter, fingers tapping tip to tip.

             OAKEN 
	(contD) 
      Big summer blow out. Half off 
      swimming suits, clogs, and a sun 
      balm of my own invention, yah?

             ANNA
      Oh, great. For now, how about 
      boots. Winter boots...and dresses? 


  
                                         40

             OAKEN
        (slight disappointment)
      That would be in our winter 
      department.

The winter department contains one outfit, a pick ax, and a 
lonely pair of boots. 

             ANNA
      Oh. Um, I was just wondering; has 
      another young woman, the Queen 
      perhaps, I dont know, passed 
      through here? 

She brings the clothes and boots to the counter. 

             OAKEN
      Only one crazy enough to be out in 
      this storm is you, dear? 

The front door suddenly blows open and in walks a mass of a 
man covered in ice. Underneath is KRISTOFF.  

             OAKEN 
	(contD) 
      You and this fellow.... Hoo hoo. 
      Big summer blow out. 

Kristoff walks right up to Anna.

             KRISTOFF
        (in her face)
      Carrots.

             ANNA
      Huh? 

             KRISTOFF
      Behind you.

             ANNA
      Oh, right. Excuse me.

Anna moves out of Kristoffs way. He grabs a bunch of 
carrots, tosses them on the counter, then moves through the 
place, gathering other supplies. 

             OAKEN
        (to Kristoff)
      A real howler in July, yah? Where 
      ever could it be coming from?

             KRISTOFF
      The North Mountain.


  
                                         41

             ANNA
        (to herself)
      North Mountain. 

Kristoff brings his supplies to the counter. Oaken counts on 
his fingertips.

             OAKEN
      Thatll be forty. 

             KRISTOFF
      Forty? No, ten. 

             OAKEN
        (sweet as pie)
      Oh dear, thats no good. See these 
      are from our winter stock, where 
      supply and demand have a big 
      problem. 

             KRISTOFF
      You want to talk about a supply and 
      demand problem? I sell ice for a 
      living. 

Kristoff motions out the window, where we see the blocks of 
ice on his sled, covered in snow. 

             ANNA
      Ooh, thats a rough business to be 
      in right now. I mean, that is 
      really...
        (he shoots her a look)
      Ahem. Thats unfortunate. 

             OAKEN
      Still forty. But I will throw in a 
      visit to Oakens sauna. Hoo hoo! 
      Hi, family. 

Kristoff and Anna turn to see a naked family waving through 
the window of the steaming sauna. 

             NAKED FAMILY
      Hoo hoo!

             KRISTOFF
      ...Tens all I got. Help me out.

             OAKEN
        (isolating the carrots)
      Ten will get you this and no more. 

Kristoff seethes. Stalemate.


  
                                         42

             ANNA
      Okay, just tell me one thing; what 
      was happening on the North 
      Mountain? Did it seem magical?

Kristoff pulls down his scarf and gives Anna a firm answer.

             KRISTOFF
      Yes! Now, back up while I deal with 
      this crook here. 

Oaken stands up, revealing his seven-foot stature.

             OAKEN
      What did you call me? 

EXT. WANDERING OAKENS TRADING POST AND SAUNA  NIGHT

Oaken stomps out the door, carrying Kristoff with one arm.

             KRISTOFF
      Okay. Okay, Im- Ow! Whoa! 

Oaken throws Kristoff, who face-plants in the snow.

             OAKEN
      Bye bye.

Oaken slams the door. Kristoff sits up. His reindeer, Sven, 
canters over, snorts, and nudges him, expectantly. 

             KRISTOFF
      No Sven, I didnt get your carrots. 

Sven huffs in his face. Kristoff turns away and sees 
something. He points to a dilapidated barn. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      But I did find us a place to sleep. 
      And its free. 

INT. WANDERING OAKENS TRADING POST AND SAUNA  NIGHT

Anna stands watching Oaken and all his great height as he 
squeezes behind the counter and sits down low again. 

             OAKEN
        (teddy bear)
      Im sorry about this violence. I 
      will add a quart of lutefisk, so 
      well have good feelings. Just the 
      outfit and boots, yah?


  
                                         43

Anna looks between Kristoffs supplies and the door. 

                                  CUT TO:

INT. OAKENS STABLES - NIGHT

Kristoff, now unfrozen, relaxes on a bed of hay, playing his 
lute and singing to (and for) Sven. 

       Reindeer(s) are Better than People

             KRISTOFF
      REINDEERS ARE BETTER THAN PEOPLE.
      SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S TRUE?

             KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) 
	(contD) 
        (throwing his voice)
      YEAH, PEOPLE WILL BEAT YOU & CURSE 
      YOU & CHEAT YOU.
      EVERY ONE OF EM'S BAD, EXCEPT YOU.
        (speaking)
      Oh, thanks, Buddy.
        (singing, as Kristoff)
      BUT PEOPLE SMELL BETTER THAN 
      REINDEERS.
      SVEN, DON'T YOU THINK I'M RIGHT?

        (As Sven)
      THATS ONCE AGAIN TRUE,
      FOR ALL EXCEPT YOU.
        (As Kristoff)
      YOU GOT ME. LET'S CALL IT A NIGHT.
        (As Sven)
      GOOD NIGHT. 
        (As Kristoff)
      DON'T LET THE FROSTBITE BITE.

The door opens. Anna enters. 

             ANNA
      Nice duet.

Kristoff sits up with a start...sees who it is.

             KRISTOFF
      Oh, its just you. What do you 
      want?

             ANNA
      I want you to take me up the North 
      Mountain.


  
                                         44

             KRISTOFF
      I dont take people places. 

He lays back down, closes his eyes. 

             ANNA
      Let me rephrase that... 

A sack of supplies lands in Kristoffs lap. 

             KRISTOFF
      Umph.

He sits up. Looks in the bag. 

             ANNA
      Take me up the North Mountain.... 
      Please. 

He eyes her. He clearly doesnt take orders. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      Look, I know how to stop this 
      winter. 

He considers, lies back down, pulls his hat over his eyes.

             KRISTOFF
      We leave at dawn.... And you forgot 
      the carrots for Sven.

A bag of carrots hits Kristoff in the face.

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      Ugh!

             ANNA
      Oops. Sorry. Sorry. Im sorry. I 
      didnt--
        (catching herself)
      We leave now. Right now. 

She steps back outside and waits, anxiously. Annoyed, 
Kristoff offers Sven a carrot. Sven has a bite. Then Kristoff 
has a bite, contemplating. 

                              SLAM CUT TO:

EXT. MOUNTAIN HIGH  NIGHT

Sven races, top speed, up a narrow cliff, pulling the sled, 
which skids precariously. Kristoff mans the reins. Anna sits 
beside him.  


  
                                         45

             KRISTOFF
        (trying to scare Anna)
      Hang on! We like to go fast!

             ANNA 
        (fearless)
      I like fast!

Anna leans back and puts her feet up on the dashboard.

             KRISTOFF
      Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down. 

He pushes her feet down.

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      This is fresh lacquer. Seriously, 
      were you raised in a barn? 

Kristoff spits on the dash to clean it. The spit flies back 
and hits Anna in the face.

             ANNA
        (grossed out)
      Ew. No, I was raised in a castle.  

She wipes off her face. 

             KRISTOFF
      So tell me, what made the Queen go 
      all ice-crazy?

             ANNA
      ...Oh well, it was all my fault. I 
      got engaged but then she freaked 
      out because Id only just met him, 
      you know, that day. And she said 
      she wouldnt bless the marriage--

             KRISTOFF
      Wait. You got engaged to someone 
      you just met?

             ANNA
      Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she 
      got mad and then she tried to walk 
      away, and I grabbed her glove-- 

             KRISTOFF
      Hang on. You mean to tell me you 
      got engaged to someone you just 
      met?!


  
                                         46

             ANNA
      Yes. Pay attention. But the thing 
      is she wore the gloves all the 
      time, so I just thought, maybe she 
      has a thing about dirt. 

             KRISTOFF 
      Didnt your parents ever warn you 
      about strangers? 

Anna eyes Kristoff up and down, then slides away from him. 

             ANNA
      Yes, they did.... But Hans is not a 
      stranger. 

             KRISTOFF
      Oh yeah? Whats his last name? 

             ANNA
      ...Of-the-Southern-Isles? 

             KRISTOFF
      Whats his favorite food? 

             ANNA
      ...Sandwiches.

             KRISTOFF
      Best friends name? 

             ANNA
      Probably John.

             KRISTOFF
      Eye color. 

             ANNA
      Dreamy. 

             KRISTOFF
      Foot size...? 

             ANNA
      Foot size doesnt matter. 

             KRISTOFF
      Have you had a meal with him yet? 
      What if you hate the way he eats? 
      What if you hate the way he picks 
      his nose?

             ANNA
      Picks his nose?


  
                                         47

             KRISTOFF
      And eats it. 

             ANNA
      Excuse me, sir. Hes a prince. 

             KRISTOFF
      All men do it. 

             ANNA
      Ew. Look it doesnt matter; its 
      true love. 

             KRISTOFF
      Doesnt sound like true love.

             ANNA
      Are you some sort of love expert?  

             KRISTOFF
      No. But I have friends who are. 

             ANNA
      You have friends who are love 
      experts.... Im not buying it.

Sven suddenly stops, ears perked in alarm. 

             KRISTOFF
        (to Anna)
      Stop talking. 

             ANNA
      No, no, no. Id like to meet these-- 

Kristoff clamps his hand over Annas mouth. 

             KRISTOFF
      I mean it. SHHH. 

Kristoff stands, looks into the dark woods surrounding them. 
Sensing something behind them, he holds up his lantern. Its 
light reflects off...EYES. Several. 

             KRISTOFF
	(contD) 
      Sven, go. Go! 

Sven takes off. 

             ANNA
      What are they? 

             KRISTOFF
      Wolves. 


  
                                         48

Flashes of white dart through the woods. Kristoff hops into 
the back of the sled, grabs a torch. Lights it. 

             ANNA
      Wolves. What do we do?

             KRISTOFF
      Ive got this. You just...dont 
      fall off and dont get eaten. 

             ANNA
      But I wanna help. 

             KRISTOFF
      No. 

             ANNA
      Why not? 

             KRISTOFF
      Because I dont trust your 
      judgement.  

             ANNA
      Excuse me?!

A wolf jumps at them, but Kristoff kicks it off.

             KRISTOFF
      Who marries a man she just met?

Anna grabs the lute, swings it right at Kristoffs head. 

             ANNA
      Its true love!

He screams, as she...BAM!...swings past Kristoff and knocks a 
wolf away. 

             KRISTOFF
        (shocked)
      Whoa. 

Just then Kristoff is yanked off the sled by another wolf. 
The torch goes flying. Anna catches it, shocked.  

             ANNA
      Christopher!

Kristoff grabs onto a loose rope hanging from the back of the 
sled and holds on for dear life as hes dragged behind.

             KRISTOFF
      Its Kristoff! 


  
                                         49

A wolf jumps on Kristoffs back. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      AH!

Anna thinks fast, uses the torch to light a blanket on fire. 

             ANNA
      Duck!

Anna throws the flaming blanket right at him. He ducks. The 
blanket hits the wolves. They tumble off Kristoff. 

             KRISTOFF
      You almost set me on fire!

Anna reaches out a hand, pulls Kristoff back onto the sled. 

             ANNA
      But I didnt. 

Sven cries out. There is a massive gorge ahead. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      Get ready to jump, Sven!

             KRISTOFF
      You dont tell him what to do!

Kristoff shoves a satchel into her arms then scoops her up.


             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      I do!  

Kristoff tosses Anna onto Sven, then unhooks Svens harness 
from the sled. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      Jump, Sven!

Sven jumps the gorge with Anna on his back. 

Kristoff goes flying off behind them, still on the sled. 

Anna and Sven land safely on the other side of the gorge. 

Kristoffs sled loses momentum. Its not going to make it. He 
leaps off. He flaps his arms, claws at the air. 

He slams into the snowy edge of the cliff. Hanging by his 
hands, he looks down to see his sled hit the ground far below 
and burst into flames. 


  
                                         50

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
        (shocked sadness)
      ...But I just paid it off. 

Suddenly, he starts to slip. He claws at the loose snow, but 
its clearly hopeless. Hes going down. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      Uh-oh. No, no, no. 

To make matters worse, an AXE comes flying right at his face. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      AH! NO, NO, NO!

The axe slams into the snow, inches from his nose. 

             ANNA
	(O.S.) 
      Grab on!

Kristoff grabs on. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      Pull, Sven! Pull!

REVEAL: The axe is tied to a rope, then wrapped around Sven. 
Anna helps Sven pull Kristoff to safety. 

Kristoff rolls onto his back, exhausted. Anna peeks down at 
the burning sled. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      Whoa.... Ill replace your sled and 
      everything in it. 

Kristoff groans.

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      And I understand if you dont want 
      to help me anymore.  

Anna walks off, sadly. Sven comes over and nuzzles Kristoff.  

             KRISTOFF 
      Of course I dont want to help her 
      anymore. In fact, this whole thing 
      has ruined me for helping anyone 
      ever again. 

             KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) 
	(contD) 
      But shell die on her own. 

             KRISTOFF  (AS SELF) 
	(contD) 
      I can live with that. 


  
                                         51

Through their conversation, they watch Anna go the wrong 
way...turn, go the other wrong way, turn, trip... 

             KRISTOFF (AS SVEN) 
	(contD) 
      But you wont get your new sled if 
      shes dead. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
        (knowing hes got a point)
      ...You know sometimes I really 
      dont like you. 

Sven licks Kristoff happily. 

             KRISTOFF (AS SELF) 
	(contD) 
        (to Anna)
      Hold up. Were coming?! 

             ANNA
        (excited)
      You are?! 
        (catching herself)
      I mean, sure. Ill let you tag 
      along.

As they step out of the thick trees, Anna catches sight of 
something far below. 

             ANNA
      Arendelle.

             KRISTOFF
      Its completely frozen.

             ANNA
      ...But itll be fine. Elsa will 
      thaw it.

             KRISTOFF
      Will she?

             ANNA
        (uncertain)
      ...Yeah. Now come on. This way to 
      the North Mountain? 

She points straight ahead.

             KRISTOFF
      More like this way. 

He points her finger up towards a perilously mighty mountain.

INT. FROZEN WILLOW TREES DAY

Anna, Kristoff, and Sven walk beneath frozen willows. The 
hanging branches glisten like Christmas lights. Sven knocks 
them with his antlers. They tinkle like chimes. 

             ANNA
      I never knew winter could be so 
      beautiful.  

Suddenly, a voice comes in from nowhere. Well call that 
voice OLAF. 

             OLAF
	(O.S.) 
      YEAH...It really is beautiful, 
      isnt it? But its so white. You 
      know, how about a little color? 
      Must we bleach the joy out of it 
      all? Im thinking like maybe some 
      crimson, chartreuse... 

While this is going on, Anna and Kristoff look around for the 
source of the rambling. They look at Sven - could he actually 
be talking? Sven looks back at them, his antlers tangled in 
branches, just as baffled as they are. 

In the meantime, a nose-less snowman, Olaf, wanders up behind 
them. 

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      How bout yellow--no, not yellow. 
      Yellow and snow? Brrrr...no go.

He stops between Kristoff and Anna. They look down at him. 
How did he get there? He suddenly looks up at Anna. 

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      Am I right? 


  
                                         53

Anna SCREAMS! Reflexes take over and she kicks Olafs head, 
sending it flying off his body and into Kristoffs arms.

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
        (cheery, to Kristoff)
      Hi!

             KRISTOFF
      Youre creepy.

Kristoff tosses the head back to Anna and they commence a 
game of hot potato.

             ANNA
      I dont want it!

             KRISTOFF
      Backatchya!

             OLAF
      Please dont drop me.

             ANNA
      Dont!

             KRISTOFF
      Come on, its just a head.

             ANNA
      No!

Olafs body runs at Anna, arms waving. 

             OLAF
	(O.S.) 
      All right, we got off to a bad 
      start.

             ANNA
      Ew, ew, the body!

Anna slams Olafs head back on the body, upside down. Olaf 
smiles happily, then looks confused. 

             OLAF
      Wait, what am I looking at right 
      now? Why are you hanging off the 
      earth like a bat?

             ANNA
        (sympathetic)
      ...Okay. Wait one second. 

Anna kneels in front of Olaf and rights his head.


  
                                         54

             OLAF 
      Oooh! Thank you!

             ANNA
      Youre welcome.

             OLAF
      Now Im perfect.

She looks over his innocent face, gets an idea. 

             ANNA
      Well, almost.

She digs into Kristoffs satchel, holds up a carrot just as 
Olaf turns toward her. The carrot accidentally slams all the 
way through his head. 

             OLAF
      Woo! Head rush!

             ANNA
      Oh! Too hard. Im sorry! I-I, I was 
      just.... Are you okay?

Olaf sees a tiny piece of carrot sticking out between his 
eyes. He lights up. 

             OLAF
      Are you kidding me? I am wonderful! 
      Ive always wanted a nose.
        (going cross-eyed to look 
         at his tiny nose)
      So cute. Its like a little baby 
      unicorn.

Anna reaches behind Olaf to the bulk of the carrot sticking 
out the back of his head, and pushes it forward.

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      What? Hey! Whoa. 
        (seeing his now big nose)
      Oh, I love it even more! Hah.... 
      All right, lets start this thing 
      over. Hi everyone. Im Olaf. And I 
      like warm hugs.

Olaf opens his arms wide to Anna. That triggers a memory. It 
takes her a moment to place it, but then she does.  

             ANNA
      Olaf?...Thats right, Olaf.


  
                                         55

             OLAF
      ...And you are?  

             ANNA
      Oh, um...Im Anna.

             OLAF
      And whos the funky-looking donkey 
      over there?

             ANNA
      Thats Sven.

             OLAF
      Uh-huh. And whos the reindeer?

             ANNA
      ...Sven.

Olaf looks from Kristoff to Sven, confused. 

             OLAF
      Oh. Theyre--oh, okay.... 
        (accepting it)
      Makes things easier for me. 

Sven tries to bite Olafs nose.

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      Ha. Aw, look at him tryin to kiss 
      my nose. 
        (gushes)
      I like you, too! 

             ANNA
      Olaf, did Elsa build you?

             OLAF
      Yeah. Why? 

Curious, Kristoff takes one of Olafs twig arms off, studies 
it. It seems to be moving in sync with his other arm. 

             ANNA
      Do you know where she is?

             KRISTOFF
        (studying the arm)
      Fascinating... 

             OLAF
      Yeah. Why? 


  
                                         56

             ANNA
      Do you think you could show us the 
      way? 

             OLAF
      Yeah. Why?

             KRISTOFF
        (bending the arm)
      How does this work?

Olafs dismembered arm slaps Kristoff across the face.

             OLAF
      Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus 
      here.
        (to Anna)
      Yeah, why?

             KRISTOFF
      Ill tell you why. We need Elsa to 
      bring back summer.

             OLAF
        (shocked)
      Summer?
        (sinking into wistfulness)
      Oh, I dont know why but Ive 
      always loved the idea of summer, 
      and sun, and all things hot.

             KRISTOFF
      Really? Im guessing you dont have 
      much experience with heat. 

             OLAF
      Nope. But sometimes I like to close 
      my eyes and imagine what itd be 
      like when summer does come.

EXT. ARENDELLE, VILLAGE  DAY

A layer of solid ice coats everything. People huddle around 
weak fires. Anxiety runs high amongst the villagers and 
guests. We pass two CITIZENS fighting over a woodpile. 

             CITIZEN ONE
      No. No. Youve got the bark facing 
      down. The bark needs to be face-up. 

             CITIZEN TWO
      Bark down is drier.

             CITIZEN ONE
      Bark up.

      Bark down.

Like a light in the dark, Hans moves through the crowd. 

             HANS
      Cloak. Does anyone need a cloak? 

             GERDA
      Arendelle is indebted to you, Your 
      Highness.

             HANS
      The castle is open. Theres soup 
      and hot glgg in the Great Hall.

He hands the stack of cloaks to a guard.

             HANS 
	(contD) 
      Here. Pass these out. 

Just then the Duke approaches Hans. 

             DUKE
      Prince Hans, are we just expected 
      to sit here and freeze while you 
      give away all of Arendelles 
      tradable goods? 

             HANS
        (tall and confident)
      Princess Anna has given her orders 
      and-- 


  
                                         60

             DUKE
      And thats another thing; has it 
      dawned on you that your princess 
      may be conspiring with a wicked 
      sorceress to destroy us all?  

Hanss nice eyes turn to threatening slits. 

             HANS
      Do not question the Princess. She 
      left me in charge, and I will not 
      hesitate to protect Arendelle from 
      treason.

             DUKE
        (flabbergasted, offended)
      Treason?! 

Suddenly they hear the alarmed whinny of Annas horse. It 
returns alone, bucking and kicking. Hans grabs its reins. 

             HANS
      Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy. 

             CROWD
        (various)
      Princess Annas horse. What 
      happened to her? Where is she?

Hans steadies the horse, looks up at the mountain. He sees 
all the panicked faces of the kingdom looking to him.

             HANS
      ...Princess Anna is in trouble. 
        (calling out)
      I need volunteers to go with me to 
      find her!

Volunteers, some from Arendelle, some from other lands, rush 
up to offer their services.

             DUKE
      I volunteer two men, my Lord! 
        (quietly to his thugs)
      Be prepared for anything, and 
      should you encounter the Queen, you 
      are to put an end to this winter.

EXT. THE NORTH MOUNTAIN DAY

Anna, Kristoff, Sven, and Olaf move through hostile terrain. 
Wind-swept icicles face horizontal.

      So how exactly are you planning to 
      stop this weather? 

             ANNA

      Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister.

             KRISTOFF
      Thats your plan? My ice business 
      is riding on you talking to your 
      sister. 

             ANNA
      Yup. 

Kristoff, so stunned by her casual plan, doesnt look where 
hes going and ends up with an ice-spike to the nose. He 
stops short, GULP, moves carefully around the spike.  

             KRISTOFF
      So youre not at all afraid of her?  

             ANNA
      Why would I be? 

             OLAF
        (oblivious)
      Yeah. I bet Elsas the nicest, 
      gentlest, warmest person ever. 

Olaf backs right into an icicle. It runs through his torso.

      Oh, look at that. Ive been 
      impaled.

                                         62

Kristoff looks around, sighs. Digs in his rucksack. 

             KRISTOFF
      ...Its too steep. Ive only got 
      one rope, and you dont know how to 
      climb mountains.

             ANNA
	(O.S.) 
      Says who? 

Sven nudges Kristoff, who looks up to see Anna trying to 
climb the cliffs flat face. 

             KRISTOFF
        (finding her ridiculous)
      What are you doing? 

             ANNA
        (straining)
      ...Im going to see my sister. 

             KRISTOFF
      Youre going to kill yourself. 

Kristoff watches her searching for footholds and hand-holds. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      I wouldnt put my foot there.

             ANNA
	(O.S.) 
      Youre distracting me.

             KRISTOFF
      Or there. How do you know Elsa even 
      wants to see you?

             ANNA
	(O.S.) 
      Im just blocking you out cause I 
      gotta concentrate here.

             KRISTOFF
      You know, most people who disappear 
      into the mountains want to be 
      alone.   

             ANNA
	(O.S.) 
      Nobody wants to be alone. Except 
      maybe you-- 

             KRISTOFF
      Im not alone.... I have friends, 
      remember?  

Anna kicks a foot above her head to catch a foot hold. 


  
                                         63

             ANNA
      You mean the love experts?  

             KRISTOFF
      Yes, the love experts!

Anna realizes shes stuck.

             ANNA
      ...Please tell me Im almost there. 

REVEAL: shes only about six feet up. Her muscles shake.

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      ...Does the air seem a bit thin to 
      you up here?

Kristoff smiles, getting a kick out of her. 

             KRISTOFF
      Hang on. 

He pulls the rope from his bag. Just then Olaf steps out from 
behind a rock and waves to Kristoff.

             OLAF 
      Hey, Sven? Not sure if this is 
      going to solve the problem, but I 
      found a staircase that leads 
      exactly where you want it to go.

             ANNA
      Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!

Anna drops off the cliff. Kristoff catches her. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      Thanks! That was like a crazy trust 
      exercise. 

She hops down, brushes off her dress, and bounds off. 
Kristoff watches after her, digging her fearless pluck. 

EXT. BASE OF THE ICE PALACE  DAY

Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf approach Elsas elegant ice palace.

             ANNA
      Whoa.

             KRISTOFF
        (in awe)
      Now thats ice. I might cry.

             ANNA
      Go ahead. I wont judge. 

Anna climbs the steps with Olaf. Sven tries to follow. His 
hooves slip out. He scrambles but cant get traction. 
Kristoff runs to his aide.

             KRISTOFF
      All right, take it easy. I gotcha. 

Kristoff settles Sven back down the stairs and pats him. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      You stay right here, buddy.

Sven obediently plops his reindeer butt down and wags his 
tail. Kristoff climbs the stairs, admiring the ice details. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      ...Flawless.  

Anna arrives at the door. Hesitates.

             OLAF
      ...Knock.... 
        (she doesnt)
      Just knock.... 
        (she doesnt. To Kristoff)
      Why isnt she knocking...? Do you 
      think she knows how to knock? 

Anna finally KNOCKS. The sound echoes inside. The ice doors 
slide open. 

             ANNA
      Ha. It opened. Thats a first.

Anna goes to step in. Kristoff follows. She gets a thought, 
stops him. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      You should probably wait out here. 

             KRISTOFF
      What?

             ANNA
      Last time I introduced her to a 
      guy, she froze everything.

             OLAF AND KRISTOFF
      Three...four...

INT. ELSAS PALACE  DAY

Anna walks into a great foyer. The place is beautiful, but 
also eerie. 

             ANNA  
      Elsa? It's me...Anna?!

Anna slips. Steadies herself. 

             ELSA
	(O.S.) 
      Anna.

Elsa steps out of the shadows onto a balcony. She sees Anna, 
looks to her longingly. 

Anna cant help but be struck by Elsas beauty.

             ANNA
      Elsa, you look different.... Its a 
      good different.... And this place 
      is amazing. 


  
                                         66

             ELSA
        (cautious, polite)
      Thank you, I never knew what I was 
      capable of. 

Anna starts to climb the stairs.

             ANNA  
      ...Im so sorry about what 
      happened. If Id known--

Elsa backs up, away from Anna.

             ELSA
        (on guard)
      No, its okay. You dont have to 
      apologize.... But you should 
      probably go, please. 

             ANNA
      But I just got here.   

             ELSA
      ...You belong in Arendelle. 

             ANNA
      So do you. 

Anna takes another step up. Elsa backs up more. 

             ELSA
      No, I belong here. Alone. Where I 
      can be who I am without hurting 
      anybody. 

             ANNA
      ...Actually, about that--

             OLAF
	(O.S.) 
      58...59...60.

             ELSA
      Wait. What is that? 

Olaf comes running in the front door. He waves. 

             OLAF  
      Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs. 

             ELSA
        (shocked)
      Olaf?

Olaf stops beside Anna, looks up at Elsa, intimidated. 


  
                                         67

             OLAF
        (bashful)
      You built me. You remember that? 

             ELSA
        (astonished)
      And you're alive? 

             OLAF
      Um...I think so?

Anna kneels down beside Olaf.

             ANNA
      Hes just like the one we built as 
      kids.... We were so close. We can 
      be like that again. 

Elsa smiles, but then a memory returns to her. 

                              FLASH CUT TO:

FLASHBACK: Young Anna is struck by Elsas powers.

             YOUNG ELSA
      Anna!

Young Anna falls unconscious. Young Elsa races to her. 

                              FLASH CUT TO:

THE PRESENT: Elsas face sinks in pain.

             ELSA
      No, we cant. 

Elsa turns and heads up the second story steps. 

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      Goodbye, Anna.  

             ANNA
      Elsa, wait--

             ELSA
        (calling back)
      Im just trying to protect you. 

Elsa continues to flee. Anna pursues. 

             ANNA
      You dont have to protect me. Im 
      not afraid. Please dont shut me 
      out again. 


  
Anna SINGS. 

                                         68

First Time in Forever, Reprise

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      PLEASE DONT SLAM THE DOOR.
      YOU DONT HAVE TO KEEP YOUR 
      DISTANCE ANYMORE.

      CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
      FOREVER,
      I FINALLY UNDERSTAND.
      FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER,
      WE CAN FIX THIS HAND IN HAND.
      WE CAN HEAD DOWN THIS MOUNTAIN 
      TOGETHER.
      YOU DONT HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR.
      CAUSE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 
      FOREVER,
      I WILL BE RIGHT HERE.

They arrive on the top floor, Elsas main living space. Elsa 
turns back to Anna, grateful, but determined. 

             ELSA
      Anna,
      PLEASE GO BACK HOME.
      YOUR LIFE AWAITS.
      GO ENJOY THE SUN
      AND OPEN UP THE GATES.

             ANNA
      Yeah, but--

             ELSA
      I know!
      YOU MEAN WELL,
      BUT LEAVE ME BE.
      YES, IM ALONE BUT IM ALONE AND 
      FREE.

Elsa opens up the balcony doors. 

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      JUST STAY AWAY AND YOULL BE SAFE 
      FROM ME.

             ANNA
      ACTUALLY, WERE NOT.

             ELSA
      WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT?


  
                                         69

             ANNA
      I GET THE FEELING YOU DONT KNOW? 

             ELSA
      WHAT DO I NOT KNOW? 

             ANNA
      ARENDELLES IN DEEP DEEP DEEP DEEP 
      SNOW.  

             ELSA
      What?    

Elsa looks past Annas shoulder out white-peaked mountains.

             ANNA
      You kind of set off an eternal 
      winter...everywhere.  

             ELSA
      Everywhere? 

             ANNA
      Its okay, you can just unfreeze 
      it.

             ELSA
      No, I cant. I dont know how.

             ANNA
      Sure you can. I know you can.  

Snow starts to swirl around the room.

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      CUZ FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOREVER, 

             ELSA
        (panicking)
      IM SUCH A FOOL!
      I CANT BE FREE!

             ANNA
      YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE AFRAID.

             ELSA
      NO ESCAPE
      FROM THE STORM INSIDE OF ME!

The snow picks up. Anna tries to fight through it.

             ANNA
      WE CAN WORK THIS OUT TOGETHER. 


  
                                         70

             ELSA
      I CANT CONTROL THE CURSE!

             ANNA
      WELL REVERSE THE STORM YOU'VE 
      MADE.

             ELSA
      ANNA, PLEASE, YOULL ONLY MAKE IT 
      WORSE!

             ANNA
      DONT PANIC. 

             ELSA
      THERES SO MUCH FEAR!

             ANNA
      WELL MAKE THE SUN SHINE BRIGHT.

             ELSA
      YOURE NOT SAFE HERE!

             ANNA
      WE CAN FACE THIS THING TOGETHER...

But as Anna sings, we lose sight of her in the thickening 
blizzard taking over the room. 

             ELSA
      NO! 

             ANNA
	(O.S.) 
      WE CAN CHANGE THIS WINTER WEATHER,
      AND EVERYTHING WILL BE...

Annas voice disappears in the storm as Elsa cries out.

             ELSA
      I CANT!

Elsas fear, so strong, sucks the blizzard back into her and 
then it bursts out, unwittingly, like a sharp snowflake.

Anna is STRUCK right in the heart. She grasps her chest in 
pain and stumbles back. She falls to her knees. 

Elsa gasps when she sees Anna. Just then, Olaf and Kristoff 
rush into the room to Annas side. 

             KRISTOFF
      Anna. Are you okay?


  
                                         71

             ANNA
      Im okay.... Im fine.

Anna gets to her feet, determined to hide the pain. 

             ELSA
        (scared)
      Whos this? Wait, it doesnt 
      matter. You have to go. 

             ANNA
      No, I know we can figure this out 
      together--

             ELSA
        (desperate)
      How? What power do you have to stop 
      this winter? To stop me? 

Anna doesnt have the answer. Kristoff sees spiky ice shadows 
creeping down the walls. Puts a protective arm around Anna. 

             KRISTOFF
      Anna, I think we should go.

             ANNA
        (close to tears)
      No. Im not leaving without you, 
      Elsa. 

             ELSA
        (heartbroken but decisive)
      Yes, you are.

Elsa waves her arms and builds a giant, menacing snowman. 
Well call him MARSHMALLOW. 

                              SLAM CUT TO:

EXT. ICE PALACE  DAY

Marshmallow holds Anna and Kristoff by the scruff of their 
necks in one hand and Olaf in the other.  

             ANNA
      Stop. Put us down! 

             OLAF 
        (to Marshmallow)
      You are a lot stronger than I think 
      you realize.

Marshmallow tosses Kristoff and Anna down the steps. 


  
                                         72

             MARSHMALLOW
        (like a bouncer)
      Go away! 

Anna and Kistoff slide past Sven, whos got his tongue stuck 
to the ice railing. 

             OLAF
	(O.S.) 
      Heads up! 

Olafs head smashes into a snowbank nearby.

             ANNA
      Olaf!

             OLAF
      Watch out for my butt!

Anna and Kristoff duck as the rest of Olaf slams into the 
snowbank. 

Marshmallow turns to go back into the castle. 

Incensed, Anna tries to march back up the stairs. 

             ANNA
      It is not nice to throw people! 

Kristoff grabs her, pulls her back. 

	     KRISTOFF
	All right feisty pants. Calm 
	down. Woaw. Just let the snow 
	man be. 

		ANNA
	Let me at him. I want to get 
	him. I.... Okay. Im Calm. 

Anna backs down...for a moment. Then she grabs a snowball and 
throws it at Marshmallow. 

The tiny little ball hits Marshmallows back, not making even 
the slightest dent. But its enough to infuriate him. He 
ROARS. Spikes shoot out of his joints. 

             KRISTOFF
      Uh-oh. Now you made him mad!

             OLAF
      ...Ill distract him. You guys go. 

Kristoff pushes Anna along. Sven runs off in the opposite 
direction. Olafs belly and butt fall and follow Sven.  

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      No, no, not you guys. 


  
                                         73

Marshmallow goes charging after Anna and Kristoff as Olafs 
head falls and lands face down in snow.

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
        (muffled)
      This just got a whole lot harder.

Anna and Kristoff leap and slide down a steep slope. They 
tumble to a stop at the bottom just as Marshmallow lands hard 
right behind them. 

Theyre off again...through a maze of conifers that sag under 
the weight of the snow, Marshmallow hot on their trail. 

             KRISTOFF
      This way!

Anna grabs a branch of a sagging trees and releases all of 
the snow. The tree snaps upright, knocking Marshmallow back. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
        (impressed)
      Ho-ho-ho!

             ANNA
      I got him!

Anna and Kristoff burst out of the conifer forest and almost 
run right off a cliff. They stop short, toes on the edge. 

             KRISTOFF
      Whoa, stop!

             ANNA
      Its a hundred foot drop.

             KRISTOFF
      Its two hundred. 

Kristoff ties the rope around Anna and pulls tight.

             ANNA
      Ow.

He drops to his knees and starts digging a u-shape in the 
snow with a pick axe. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      Whats that for? 

             KRISTOFF
      Im digging a snow anchor.


  
                                         74

             ANNA
        (not trusting)
      Okay. What if we fall?

             KRISTOFF
      Theres twenty feet of fresh powder 
      down there; itll be like landing 
      on a pillow.... Hopefully. 

They hear an angry ROAR coming closer.

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      Okay, Anna. On three. 

Anna preps for the jump like a boxer getting ready to fight.  

             ANNA
      Okay. You tell me when... 

             KRISTOFF
      One...

             ANNA
      ...Im ready to go....

             KRISTOFF
      Two...

             ANNA
        (pumped up)
      ...I was BORN ready! Yes!

             KRISTOFF
      Calm down. 

A huge tree flies through the air toward them.

             ANNA
	(O.S.) 
      TREE!

Anna jumps and pulls Kristoff over the edge with her. They 
hang upside down over the cliff by the rope. The rope catches 
their fall.

             KRISTOFF
      Whoa! That happened. 

Back up top, Olaf emerges from the woods. Hes a complete 
mess, all his body parts are in the wrong places. He huffs 
and puffs, struggling to run.

             OLAF
      Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape. 


  
                                         75

He stops. Puts his body back together in the right order.

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven! 
      Whered ya guys go? We totally lost 
      Marshmallow back there! 

Marshmallow steps up behind Olaf. Olaf turns to face him. 

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
        (happily)
      Hey. We were just talking about 
      you. All good things, all good 
      things. 

Marshmallow roars and approaches Kristoffs snow anchor. 

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      NO!

Olaf jumps onto Marshmallows leg trying to stop him, but not 
making much of a difference. 

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      This is not making much of a 
      difference!

Marshmallow flicks Olaf off his leg and right over the cliff. 

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      WHOA!

Olaf passes Anna and Kristoff. 

             ANNA
      Olaf!

             OLAF
      Hang in there, guys!

Marshmallow starts yanking Kristoff and Annas rope up.

             ANNA
      Wait, what? 

Kristoffs head hits the cliff. 

             KRISTOFF
      Aargghh!

Kristoff passes out and hangs like a rag doll. 

             ANNA
      Kristoff!


  
                                         76

Marshmallow pulls them up. He roars and breathes snow all 
over them. 

             MARSHMALLOW
      Dont come back!

             ANNA
        (grossed out by his snow 
         breath)
      Ugh. We wont. 

Anna whips out a knife and cuts the rope. Kristoff comes to 
just as they fall. They both SCREAM!

SLAM!

REVEAL: Anna opens her eyes to find herself buried up to her 
shoulders in the soft thick snow. She laughs. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      Hey, you were right. Just like a 
      pillow.

She looks up to see Olafs upper half hanging onto Kristoffs 
boots, which are sticking out of the snow. 

             OLAF
        (shaking the boots)
      I cant feel my legs! I cant feel 
      my legs!

Suddenly, Kristoffs head pops up. He spits out snow.

             KRISTOFF
      Those are my legs. 

Olafs bottom goes running by. 

             OLAF
        (to Kristoff)
      Ooh. Hey, do me a favor, grab my 
      butt.

Kristoff grabs Olafs head and puts it on his body. 

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      Oh, that feels better. 

Sven walks up and sniffs Olafs nose. 

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      Hey, Sven!


  
                                         77

Olaf turns to Anna and Kristoff just as Sven goes to bite off 
his nose -- and misses. 

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      He found us. 
        (to Sven, funny voice)
      Whos my cute little reindeer?

             KRISTOFF
      Dont talk to him like that.

Kristoff goes over to help Anna, who is stuck in the snow.   

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      Here.

He lifts her out easily. 

             ANNA
        (impressed)
      Whoa! 

             KRISTOFF
      You okay?

             ANNA
      Thank you.

They meet eyes. Wait. Is that chemistry?

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      ...Um.... Hows your head?

She touches the spot where he banged his head. 

             KRISTOFF
        (in pain)
      Ah! Ooh! 

He catches himself. Waves off the pain with a giggle. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      I mean, Its fine. Ah...Im good. 
      Ha. Ive got a thick skull.

             OLAF
      I dont have a skull.... Or bones.  

             KRISTOFF
      ...So.... 

The awkwardness is killing him. 


  
                                         78

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
        (shy)
      Now what? 

             ANNA
        (shy)
      Now what?
        (then...panicking)
      Now what?! Oh! What am I gonna do? 
      She threw me out. I cant go back 
      to Arendelle with the weather like 
      this. And then theres your ice 
      business--

             KRISTOFF
      Hey, hey, dont worry about my ice 
      business...
        (noticing something)
      Worry about your hair?! 

She thinks he means it looks bad. She smooths it down.

             ANNA
      What? I just fell off a cliff. You 
      should see your hair. 

             KRISTOFF
      No, yours is turning white.  

She grabs her braid as a tendril turns white. 

             ANNA
      White? Its what? 

             KRISTOFF
      Its because she struck you; isnt 
      it? 

             ANNA
      Does it look bad?

             KRISTOFF
        (thinking)
      ...No. 

Olafs head pops up. Hes holding his head up off his body to 
join the conversation.

             OLAF
      You hesitated. 

             KRISTOFF
      No, I didnt. Anna, you need help. 
      Now, come on. 


  
                                         79

He heads towards the sunset. Sven and Olaf follow. 

             OLAF
      Okay! Where are we going? 

             KRISTOFF
      To see my friends.

             ANNA
        (catching up)
      The love experts? 

             OLAF
      Love experts?!

             KRISTOFF
      Yes. And dont worry; theyll be 
      able to fix this.   

             ANNA
      How do you know?  

He looks her over, remembering the moment he saw the trolls 
heal her as a child.

             KRISTOFF
      ...Because Ive seen them do it 
      before. 

As they round the bend, the sun sets and Olaf turns to Sven. 

             OLAF
      I like to consider myself a love 
      expert. 

                                  CUT TO:

INT. ELSAS PALACE  DAY

Elsa paces, distraught. She talks to herself. 

             ELSA
        (mantra-style)
      Get it together. Control it. Dont 
      feel. Dont feel. Dont FEEL!

She hears ice cracking. Stops. Looks around. Shes left a 
sharp wake of ice spikes behind her on the floor. They grow 
up the wall, taking over the castle.

                              DISSOLVE TO:


  
                                         80

EXT. BLACK MOUNTAINS  NIGHT

The Northern Lights are bright. Olaf stares at them in awe as 
he rides on Svens back. 

             OLAF
      Look, Sven. The skys awake.

Behind Olaf and Sven, Anna walks with Kristoff. She shivers. 

             KRISTOFF
      Are you cold? 

             ANNA
      ...A little. 

He reaches like he might put an arm around her, but decides 
against it. He looks around as if he doesnt know what to do, 
then gets a thought. 

             KRISTOFF
      Wait. Come here. 

He takes her hand and pulls her around a bend into a rock-
lined pass. 

Steam vents, powered by the volcanic activity, dot the path. 
He holds her hands over one of them. 

             ANNA
      Oooh.... Thats nice. 

They continue on the path, walking from vent to vent. 

             KRISTOFF
        (taking a deep breath)
      So, about my friends...well, I say 
      friends, theyre more like 
      family.... Anyway, when I was a 
      kid, it was just me and 
      Sven...until they took me in. 

             ANNA
        (moved)
      They did?

             KRISTOFF
        (nervous ramble)
      Yeah. I dont want to scare you,  
      they can be a little bit 
      inappropriate...and loud...very 
      loud...theyre also stubborn at 
      times, and a little overbearing. 
      And heavy. Really, really heavy.

             KRISTOFF
	(cont'd)
      But theyre fine.. Youll get it. 
      They mean well.

Anna touches Kristoffs arm, reassuringly. 

             ANNA
      Kristoff, they sound wonderful. 

Kristoff smiles, appreciating her sincerity.

             KRISTOFF
      Okay then....

Mustering the courage, Kristoff steps forward and with a wave 
of the arms announces--

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      Meet my family.

REVEAL: hes surrounded by rocks. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
        (to the rocks)
      Hey, guys!

As Kristoff and Sven move through the rocks, waving and 
greeting, Olaf and Anna stand frozen, dumbfounded.

             ANNA
        (to herself)
      ...Theyre rocks. 

             OLAF
        (realizing)
      Hes crazy. 
        (covertly, to Anna)
      Ill distract them while you run.
        (Loud and slow to a rock)
      Hi, Svens family! Its nice to 
      meet you!
        (quietly to Anna)
      Anna, because I love you, I insist 
      you run.
        (to the rock)
      I understand youre love experts!
        (to Anna)
      Why arent you running? 

Anna snaps out of her shock and starts backing away. 

             ANNA
      Okay. Um...Im gonna go-- 

Just then the rocks around her start rolling. 


  
                                         82

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
        (panicking)
      Kristoff!

Olaf lights up and chases the rocks, who surround Kristoff 
and unfold as trolls. 

             BULDA
      KRISTOFFS HOME! 

             TROLLS (VARIOUS)
      Kristoff! Kristoffs home! Its 
      been too long! Kristoffs home!

Olaf jumps around all excitedly.

             OLAF
        (excitedly)
      Kristoffs home. 

He then stops, confused, and looks to one of the trolls. 

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      Wait? Kristoff? 

Anna watches, shocked and confused. 

The trolls all want Kristoffs attention. One troll yanks him 
down with a boulders strength. 

             TROLL ONE
      Oh, lemme look at you!

Another troll tries to pull off his clothes.

             TROLL TWO
      Oh, take off your clothes, 
      Kristoff; I wash them. 

             KRISTOFF
        (holding up his pants)
      Ah! No. Im gonna keep my clothes 
      on, thank you. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      Great to see you all. Wheres 
      grandpa? 

             MUSHROOM KID TROLL
      Hes napping. But look, I grew a 
      mushroom. 

             TROLL SCOUT KID
      And I earned my fire crystal.

             KIDNEY STONE TROLL
      I passed a kidney stone.

             PICK ME UP TROLL
      Pick me up.  

The kid troll jumps up on Kristoffs arm. Kristoff sinks 
under the weight of him. 

Anna still stares, confused, then realizes...

             ANNA
      Trolls? Theyre trolls.

Silence. All troll eyes turn to Anna. Blink. Blink. 

             BULDA
      ...Hes brought a girl!

             TROLLS
	(TOGETHER)
      Hes brought a girl!

Suddenly Anna is surrounded by trolls. They body-surf/roll 
Anna over to Kristoff. She falls into his arms.

             ANNA
      Whats going on?

             KRISTOFF
      Ive learned to just roll with it.

Bulda climbs on top of her husband, Cliff, to get a good look 
at Anna. She studies her like shes a piece of cattle.

             BULDA
      Let me see. Bright eyes. Working 
      nose. Strong teeth. Yes, yes, yes. 
      Shell do nicely for our Kristoff. 

             ANNA
      Wait. Oh. Um. No. 

             KRISTOFF
      Youve got the wrong idea. That's 
      not why I brought her here.

             ANNA
      Right. Were not. Im not--

Anna laughs, uncomfortable, not knowing what to say.

Kristoff looks over at Anna. She actually looks shockingly 
beautiful dressed in moss, lit by shimmering crystals. 

             ALL TROLLS
      EVERYONE'S A BIT OF A FIXER UPPER,

During this last bit Anna and Kristoff are looking at each 
other differently. Hmmm. Maybe those trolls are right?  
Sparks! Chemistry!

      Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to be

      Youre getting married.

Just then, Anna collapses. Kristoff catches her. Shes 
shivering something fierce. 

             KRISTOFF
      Anna? 

He pulls off her cape and hat.

      Shes as cold as ice. 

Just then Grand Pabbie pushes his way through the crowd. 
Trolls clear the way for Pabbie. He stops at the edge of the 
pit.

             GRAND PABBIE
      Theres strange magic here! 

             KRISTOFF
      Grand Pabbie!

             GRAND PABBIE
      Bring her to me, Kristoff. 

Kristoff helps Anna over. Pabbie looks into her weak eyes.

             GRAND PABBIE 
	(contD) 
      Anna, your life is in danger. There 
      is ice in your heart, put there by 
      your sister. If not removed, to 
      solid ice will you freeze, forever. 

             ANNA
      What...? No. 

             KRISTOFF
      So remove it, Grand Pabbie. 

             GRAND PABBIE
      I cant. If it was her head, that 
      would be easy. But only an act of 
      true love can thaw a frozen heart. 

             ANNA
      An act of true love? 

             BULDA
        (googley, to her hubby)
      A true loves kiss, perhaps?  

A bunch of trolls give each other kisses. 

Anna shivers again, collapsing into Kristoffs arms. More of 
her hair turns white. 

             KRISTOFF
      Anna, weve got to get you back to 
      Hans. 

             ANNA

Kristoff grabs Svens antlers. Sven pulls them out.

Kristoff helps Anna onto Sven and hops up behind her.

      Come on, Olaf!

Sven takes off. Olaf grabs Svens tail, rides with them.

EXT.  ELSAS PALACE - DAWN

Hans and the men tread cautiously towards the castle. 

             HANS
      We are here to find Princess Anna. 
      Be on guard, but no harm is to come 
      to the Queen. Do you understand?

The Dukes thugs exchange a look. Suddenly, a mass of snow 
rises from the ground behind Hans. Its Marshmallow, Elsas 
snow guard. 

             MARSHMALLOW
      Go away!

He slams a fist inches from Hans. Hans deftly dodges out of 
the way. All of the guards take up arms against Marshmallow, 
who quickly knocks them over.

Marshmallow throws down a guard and his horse, who topple 
over Hans. Marshmallow raises his foot to stomp on Hans, but 
Hans barrel-rolls himself to safety. He sees his sword, 
leaps, and grabs it. 

Just then, Elsa peeks out the front doors.

The Dukes two thugs see her. 

             DUKES THUG
      The Queen.  

The thugs charge up the stairs.

INT. ELSAS PALACE  DAY

They guards burst through the ice doors. 

Elsa flees to the top floor of her palace. The guards pursue. 

They trap her on the top floor, raise their crossbows.  

             ELSA
        (scared)
      No. Please.

One of the thugs shoots an arrow right at Elsa. At the last 
moment she creates an ice wall. It stops the arrow, inches 
from her face. 

The thugs reposition to take another shot. 

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      Stay away! 

Elsa shoots ice at the thugs. They duck out of the way and 
continue the attack. 

             THUG
      Get her! Get her!

Elsa fights for her life.  

BACK OUTSIDE: Hans is nearly crushed by Marshmallow. He rolls 
away. Jumps to his feet. And with agile might, he slices 
Marshmallows leg off with his sword. Marshmallow stumbles 
back, off balance. And falls off over the cliff, but not 
before striking Hans. Hans goes over the edge. 

REVEAL: Hans clings to the ice steps. His men help him up and 
they rush into the ice palace.

INT. ICE PALACE  DAY

Elsa is surrounded. Its do or die. In two swift moves, Elsa 
traps one thug in a cage of spikes that threaten his neck. 

The other she pushes back with a wall of ice....up against 
the balcony doors...which BURST and CRACK. 

OUT ONTO THE BALCONY.... The balcony doors shatter. The thug 
is pushed to the edge. Hes inches away from falling to his 
death. 

BACK INSIDE: Hans and his men run in. See the destruction and 
the thugs near death.

             HANS
      Queen Elsa! Dont be the monster 
      they fear you are. 

Elsa snaps out of her rage. She sees the men, frightened, 
moments from death. She stops. Elsa looks to Hans, 
overwhelmed, frightened.

The wall retreats from the thug on the balcony. The ice 
spikes lower from the second thugs neck. He takes advantage 
and aims his crossbow at Elsas back. 

Seeing it. Hans runs and pushes the crossbow up just as the 
arrow releases. The arrow hits the ice chandelier, hanging 
directly above Elsa.

The chandelier comes CRASHING DOWN. 

Elsa dives out of the way but she falls in the blast. 

All we see is ice smashing like glass, and all we hear is the 
sound of it shattering as it rings out. 

                              CUT TO BLACK.

FADE IN ON:

Elsas face as her eyes flutter open. 

She sits up. Shes surrounded by stone. 

INT. ARENDELLE, DUNGEON  DAY

Elsa looks to the nearby window. Tries to rush to it. Shes 
pulled taut by giant shackles that fit like iron gloves. 
Shes chained to the wall. 

Elsa strains to looks out a window...

INSET WINDOW: Arendelle is outside, frozen solid and getting 
further buried under the ice and snow that is falling. 

             ELSA
      No....What have I done? 

Hans enters. He hangs a torch by the door. 

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      Why did you bring me here? 

             HANS
      I couldnt just let them kill you. 


  
                                         91

      But Im a danger to Arendelle. Get 
      Anna.   

             HANS
      Anna has not returned.... 

Elsa looks to the storm with worry. 

             HANS 
	(contD) 
      If you would just stop the winter, 
      bring back summer...please.

Elsa meets his eyes, desperate.

             ELSA
      Dont you see...I cant. 

Hans sees the sincerity in her eyes. 

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      You have to tell them to let me go. 

Hans walks to the door. He takes the torch.

             HANS
      I will do what I can.

He opens the door and leaves. 

Elsa, distraught, hears cracking. She looks down as her 
shackles begin to freeze over. The storm outside picks up. 

                                  CUT TO:

EXT. THE FJORDS  DAY

Sven charges down the mountain with Kristoff and Anna on his 
back. Olaf slides along beside them, penguin-style. 

Anna shivers in Kristoffs arms. Shes weakening. Kristoff 
takes off his hat and puts it on her head. 

             KRISTOFF
      Just hang in there. 
        (to Sven)
      Come on, buddy, faster!

             OLAF
      I will! 

He disappears into the village streets. 

             OLAF
	(O.S.)  
	(contD) 
      Hello!

             TOWNSWOMAN
	(O.S.) 
      Ah! Its alive!

EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD  DAY

Guards see Kristoff and Anna approaching.

             GUARD
      Its Princess Anna!

                                  CUT TO:

Sven skids to a stop outside the gates. Kristoff slides off, 
holding Anna, and carries her to the gate.

             KRISTOFF
      Ive got you.

Anna looks up at him, gratefully. 

             ANNA
      ...Are you g-gonna be okay?

             KRISTOFF
        (touched, reassuring)
      Dont worry about me.

Just then the castle gates open. Gerda, Kai, and a handmaid 
rush to help Anna. 

             GERDA
      Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick. 

             KAI
      My Lady. You are freezing. 

             GERDA
      You poor girl, youre freezing. 
      Lets get you inside. 


  
                                         93

             KRISTOFF
      Get her warm and find Prince Hans, 
      immediately.

             KAI
      We will. Thank you. 

Anna is swept away from Kristoff and into the palace grounds.

             KRISTOFF 
      Make sure shes safe!

Kristoff is shut out as the castle gates close on him. 

Kristoff stands there with Sven for a beat, staring with 
worry at the closed gates. 

Finally, he sighs, turns and walks off. Sven reluctantly 
follows.

                                  CUT TO:

INT. LIBRARY  DAY

Hans stands with the dignitaries and guards.

             HANS
      Im going back out to look for 
      Princess Anna.

             FRENCH DIGNITARY
      You cannot risk going out there 
      again. 

             HANS
      If anything happens to her--

             SPANISH DIGNITARY
      If anything happens to the 
      Princess, you are all Arendelle has 
      left. 

Hans hesitates, realizing how much this kingdom has come to 
depend on him. Is he really all they have left? 

Just then the door opens and Gerda and Kai bring in Anna. 

             KAI 
      Hes in here. Prince Hans. 

             HANS
      Anna. 


  
                                         94

Hans rushes to Anna. She falls into his arms.

             HANS 
	(contD) 
      Youre so cold. 

             ANNA
        (weak, but desperate)
      Hans, you have to kiss me.  

             HANS
      What? 

             ANNA
      Now. Here we go.

She tries to kiss him, but is too weak to pull herself up in 
his arms. 

             GERDA
      Well give you two some privacy. 

Everyone shuffles out, leaving Hans and Anna alone.  

             HANS
      What happened out there?

             ANNA
      Elsa struck me with her powers. 

             HANS
      You said shed never hurt you.

             ANNA
      I was wrong. 

Anna crumbles, weak. 

             HANS
      Anna.

Hans carries her to a couch, sets her down.  

             ANNA
        (shivering more)
      She froze my heart and only an act 
      of true love can save me. 

             HANS
        (understanding)
      A true loves kiss. 

He takes her chin in his hand and gives her a tender smile. 
He leans in slowly...gently... 


  
Then he stops. 

                                         95

             HANS 
	(contD) 
      Oh, Anna. If only there was someone 
      out there who loved you. 

             ANNA
     What? 

Hans gets up, leaving her there. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      ...You said you did.

He goes to the window and shuts the curtains. 

             HANS
      As thirteenth in line in my own 
      kingdom, I didnt stand a chance. I 
      knew Id have to marry into the 
      throne somewhere-- 

             ANNA
      What are you talking about? 

             HANS
        (putting out the candles)
      As heir, Elsa was preferable, of 
      course. But no one was getting 
      anywhere with her. But you- 

             ANNA
      Hans?

             HANS
      You were so desperate for love you 
      were willing to marry me, just like 
      that.

Hans crosses the room, grabs a pitcher of water from a table 
and goes to the fireplace. 

             HANS 
	(contD) 
      I figured, after we married, Id 
      have to stage a little accident for 
      Elsa.  

Hans pours the water on the fireplace, putting out the fire. 
Anna tries to stop him. She falls to the floor, weak. 

             ANNA
      Hans. No, stop.


  
                                         96

             HANS
      But then she doomed herself, and 
      you were dumb enough to go after 
      her. 

             ANNA
      Please. 

             HANS
        (chuckles)
      All thats left now is to kill Elsa 
      and bring back summer. 

Hans approaches Anna.

             ANNA
      ...Youre no match for Elsa.

He bends down, takes her chin in his hand again, this time 
not so gently.

             HANS
      No, youre no match for Elsa. I, on 
      the other hand, am the hero who is 
      going to save Arendelle from 
      destruction. 

She wrenches her face out of his hands. 

             ANNA
        (anger)
      You wont get away with this.

Hans rises and crosses to the door.

             HANS
      Oh, I already have.  

Hans leaves and shuts her in, locking the door. Anna 
struggles to the door, yanks on the locked handle. 

             ANNA
        (hoarse and weak)
      Please, somebody help.

The rest of her hair turns white and she crumbles to the 
floor.

INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER  NIGHT

The Duke looks out the window at the growing snowstorm. He 
rubs his arms and shivers. 

             DUKE
      Its getting colder by the minute. 
      If we dont do something soon, 
      well all freeze to death. 

Hans comes in, putting on his most distraught face. 

             SPANISH DIGNITARY
      Prince Hans.  

             HANS
      Princess Anna is...dead.

             VARIOUS DIGNITARIES
      What...? No.... Mon dieu.

Hans stumbles, weak with grief. The men help him to a chair. 

             DUKE
      What happened to her?

             HANS
      She was killed by Queen Elsa.

             DUKE
      Her own sister.

             HANS
        (really putting it on)
      At least we got to say our marriage 
      vows...before she died in my arms.

He bows his head in a brilliant display of teary grief. 

             DUKE
      There can be no doubt now; Queen 
      Elsa is a monster and we are all in 
      grave danger. 

             SPANISH DIGNITARY
      Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to 
      you.

Hans nods; he knows what hes being asked to do, and hell do 
it with the perfect amount of authority and gravitas.  


  
                                         98

             HANS
      With a heavy heart, I charge Queen 
      Elsa of Arendelle with treason and 
      sentence her to death. 

INT. ELSAS DUNGEON  DAY

The cell ices over. Elsa looks out at the storm that is  
devastating Arendelle, then hears the guards approaching.

             GUARD
	(O.S.) 
      Shes dangerous. Move quickly and 
      with resolve.

Elsa pulls at her shackles. They crack. Just as the door 
busts open, the weight of the ice crumbles the walls. The men 
duck out of the way. 

Hans pushes his way into the room...sees... 

The back wall is blown open. Broken shackles rest on the 
floor. Elsa is gone. 

                                  CUT TO:

EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE  DAY

Kristoff heads into the mountains. Sven lags behind, not 
wanting to follow. He looks back at the kingdom, then shakes 
his head. Enough. 

He runs past Kristoff. Stops and turns to face him. He snorts 
and grunts.    

             KRISTOFF
      What is it, buddy? 

Sven nudges Kristoff with his antlers.

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      Hey, watch it. Whats wrong with 
      you? 

Sven snorts with more conviction, moos, brays. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
        (avoiding)
      ...I dont understand you when you 
      talk like that. 


  
                                         99

Kristoff tries to walk on ahead, but Sven uses his antlers to 
lift Kristoff off the ground. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      Ah! Stop it! Put me down! 

Sven drops him hard then yells at him once more. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      No, Sven! Were not going back! 

Sven shakes his head, angrily. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      Shes with her true love.

Sven makes an of-course-she-isnt face. Kristoff gets it; 
hes made his point. 

Just then the wind picks up. Kristoff looks back at the 
kingdom. Sees a violent winter storm swirling over the 
castle. Sharp ice claws its way up the castle, encasing it. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      Anna.

Without hesitating, he dashes back down the mountain. Sven 
runs after him, catches up. Kristoff grabs Svens harness and 
jumps onto his back.

INT. LIBRARY  NIGHT

Anna shivers by the door. She looks up to see ice overtaking 
the ceiling. 

The door handle suddenly jiggles. Stops. Jiggles again. 

             ANNA
        (barely a whisper)
      Help.

CLICK. The door swings open. We see a carrot in the lock and 
hear a giggle of victory. Olaf takes the carrot, puts it back 
on his face. Then he sees Anna lying there. 

             OLAF
      Anna. Oh no.

He runs to the fireplace. Throws in some fresh wood, 
including one of his own arms, which he quickly rescues, 
before striking a match and relighting the fire. 


  
                                        100

             ANNA
      Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.

             OLAF
      Whoa! So this is heat.... 
        (considering)
      I love it. 

He reaches a twig finger toward the flames. It catches on 
fire.

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      Ooh! But dont touch it!

He shakes the flame out, as he rushes over to help Anna to 
the fire.

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      So, wheres Hans? What happened to 
      your kiss?

             ANNA
      I was wrong about him. It wasnt 
      true love.     

             OLAF
        (confused innocence)
      Huh. But we ran all the way here? 

             ANNA
      Please Olaf, you cant stay here; 
      youll melt.  

             OLAF
      I am not leaving here until we find 
      some other act of true love to save 
      you. 

He sits down behind her, stubbornly. Leans his back against 
hers and thinks. 

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      ...Do you happen to have any ideas? 

             ANNA
      I dont even know what love is. 

             OLAF
        (confident)
      Thats okay, I do.... 

Olaf hops back up and puts a soothing hand on her shoulder. 


  
                                        101

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      Love is...putting someone elses 
      needs before yours, like, you know, 
      how Kristoff brought you back here 
      to Hans and left you forever.

             ANNA
      ...Kristoff loves me? 

             OLAF
      Wow, you really dont know anything 
      about love, do you?

His face starts to melt. 

             ANNA
      Olaf, youre melting. 

             OLAF 
        (sweet and reassuring)
      Some people are worth melting for. 

But then...his face REALLY melts. He panics, pushes the snow 
back in place. 

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      Just maybe not right this second. 

Suddenly, the window blows open, cold wind sweeps in. 

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      Dont worry, Ive got it! 

Olaf flitters to the window. He pulls one panel of it shut 
but struggles with the second panel.

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
        (determined)
      Were going to get through-- 
        (distracted)
      Oh, wait. Hang on. Im getting 
      something. 

He breaks an icicle off the window, uses it as a telescope 
and sees...

Kristoff and Sven running back down the mountain. 

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      Its Kristoff and Sven! Theyre 
      coming back this way. 

             ANNA
      ...They-they are? 


  
                                        102

             OLAF
      Wow, hes really moving fast. 
      Huh.... I guess I was wrong. I 
      guess Kristoff doesnt love you 
      enough to leave you behind.    

Anna tries to get to her feet. 

             ANNA
      Help me up, Olaf. Please.

He hurries over, tumbling over the couch, knocking over the 
chess set and water jugs. 

             OLAF
      No, no, no, no, no. You need to 
      stay by the fire and keep warm. 

             ANNA
      I need to get to Kristoff. 

             OLAF
        (clueless)
      Why...? 
        (realizing)
      Oh, oh, oh, I know why. 

He hops around in an excited display of hope.

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      Theres your act of true love, 
      right there, riding across the 
      fjords like a valiant, pungent 
      reindeer king! Come on!

The walls crack under the ice pressure. 

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      Look out!

They rush out the room just as the ceiling collapses.

INT. CASTLE HALLWAY  DAY

Anna and Olaf struggle down the hall. Ice spikes grow and 
block their path. 

             OLAF
      Were trapped. 

Anna looks around desperately for a way out.


  
EXT. FJORD  DAY 

                                        103

Elsa runs, but is nearly blinded by the snow and wind. 

EXT. CASTLE - DAY

Anna and Olaf bust open a window. The storm is so strong it 
sweeps the window panes away. 

             OLAF
      Slide, Anna. 

Its a long, snowy way down. But what choice do they have? 
They slide down the iced-covered building. 

Anna arrives at the bottom, weak but uninjured. Olaf gathers 
snow along the way. He arrives at the bottom as a giant 
snowball.

             OLAF 
	(contD) 
      We made it!

He shakes off the extra snow as Anna struggles to her feet. 

EXT. FJORD  DAY

Kristoff and Sven bound off the mountain and sprint across 
the frozen fjord waters and right into the heart of the 
storm. Its white-out wind pushes them back. But they fight 
through. 

             KRISTOFF
      Come on, buddy, faster.

                                  CUT TO:

Anna and Olaf reach the shore of the fjords.

             ANNA
      Kristoff!

The wind lifts Olaf up and pulls him apart. He goes swirling 
off into the storm. 

             OLAF
      Keep going, Anna!

Anna struggles on. 


  
                                        104

             ANNA
      Kristoff!

Kristoff rides Sven past cracking, frozen ships. Sven 
struggles over the uneven surface.

                                  PAN TO:

             KRISTOFF
      Come on! Come on!

Suddenly, a mangled ship, risen by ice, capsizes over them. 
They give it all theyve got as debris falls all around them 
and the mast shatters. They make it past just as the entire 
ship slams down and cracks the thick ice beneath their feet.

The ice opens up. Sven bravely jumps over a gap. But its too 
wide. He bucks Kristoff to safety, but lands in the freezing 
water and disappears below.

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      Sven? Sven!

At first theres nothing but the wind and the tumbling icy 
water. But suddenly, Sven surfaces and claws his way to a 
floating ice chunk. He calls out, signalling for Kristoff to 
go on. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      Good boy.

                                  CUT TO:

Anna moves blindly across the fjord. Annas hands frost over 
an icy blue. She stumbles on, determined. But shes running 
out of time. 

She clutches her chest. The color in her eyes fades, the 
inevitable is coming.

Kristoff, lost in the white-out, doesnt know which way to 
turn. But then he hears a faint--

                                  CUT TO:

             ANNA
	(O.S.)
      Kristoff.

             KRISTOFF
      Anna...? Anna!

                              WHITE OUT TO:


  
                                        105

Elsa struggles through her own storm, but the fear is 
consuming her. A dark shadow approaches. Its Hans.

             HANS
      Elsa. You cant run from this!

Elsa backs away from him.  

             ELSA
      ...Just take care of my sister. 

             HANS
      Your sister? She returned from the 
      mountain weak and cold. She said 
      you froze her heart.

             ELSA
      What? No.

             HANS
      I tried to save her, but it was too 
      late. Her skin was ice. Her hair 
      turned white...

Elsas face sinks as she realizes what she has done.  

             HANS 
	(contD) 
      Your sister is dead... because of 
      you.

Elsa drops to her knees, emotionally broken. And with that, 
the swirling storm suddenly stops. The snow freezes mid-air, 
hangs suspended, trapped in grief. 

Citizens and dignitaries rush to the walls edge and look out 
to see...

Anna, barely able to move but now able to see across the 
fjords to...

             ANNA
        (a whisper)
      Kristoff.

             KRISTOFF
      Anna.

Anna pushes on towards Kristoff. He runs top speed towards 
her. Theres still a lot of fjord to cross, but Kristoff is 
giving it all hes got. Hes going to make it. 

But then, Anna hears the sound of a sword being drawn from 
its scabbard. She turns and sees Hans, behind Elsa, as he 
raises his sword over his head.


  
                                        106

             ANNA
      Elsa.

Anna looks back at Kristoff as he runs for her. She gives him 
a longing look, but then turns away from him and then...

Using all of her remaining strength, as Hans brings his sword 
down, Anna throws herself in front of Elsa. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      No!

In that instant, Anna freezes to solid ice. The sword hits 
her instead of Elsa. The sword shatters completely. The force 
of it sends Hans flying back and knocks him out. 

             ELSA
      Anna!

Elsa rushes to Anna and touches her sisters frozen face.

             ELSA 
	(contD) 
      Oh, Anna...no...no, please no.

Olaf walks up and sees Anna, frozen.

             OLAF
        (confused, sad)
      Anna?

Elsa hugs Anna and cries. 

Kristoff watches in shocked despair. Sven steps up to his 
side. 

Citizens and dignitaries on the castle walls bow their heads. 

All of Arendelle is joined in somber silence. 

But then, Anna warms. She begins to thaw. 

Olaf looks up and gasps. Kristoff and Sven notice, light up.

Anna bends her arm and embraces Elsa. 

             ELSA
      Wha-? Anna?

Anna opens her eyes. She smiles at Elsa, relieved. 

             ANNA
      Oh, Elsa.

They embrace.


  
                                        107

             ELSA
      ...You sacrificed yourself for me? 

             ANNA
        (weak)
      ...I love you.  

Olaf realizes whats happened. Hes so excited about it, he 
lifts his head right off his body and exclaims-- 

             OLAF
      An act of true love will thaw a 
      frozen heart. 

             ELSA
        (processing)
      Love...will thaw...
        (realizing)
      Love.... Of course. 

Elsa looks at Anna with confidence. 

             ANNA
      Elsa?

             ELSA
      Love.


Elsa lifts her arms, and the ground shakes and cracks. The 
ice and snow breaks away and rises high into the air. 

Beneath their feet the bow of a ship thaws. 

The entire fjord melts and other boats right themselves.

The villagers come out to see the warmth returning.

In one final wave, Elsa draws all of the snow into a giant 
snowflake in the sky, then waves it away, leaving only a warm 
summer day. 

             ANNA
      I knew you could do it.

             OLAF 
        (melting, good-naturedly)
      Hands down, this is the best day of 
      my life...and quite possibly the 
      last.

             ELSA
      Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy.


  
                                        108

Elsa waves her hand and surrounds Olaf with a swirl of cold 
air. He refreezes. Above his head she leaves a little, 
perpetually-snowing storm cloud. Olaf loves it. 

             OLAF
      Hey, my own personal flurry.

Kristoff sees Hans trying to get to his feet. He marches 
toward him, prepared for a fight. But Anna puts up a hand and 
stops him. 

             ANNA
      Uh. Uh. Uh. 

Shell handle this. She goes over to Hans. 

             HANS
        (confused)
      Anna? But she froze your heart. 

             ANNA
      The only frozen heart around here 
      is yours.  

She turns away from him, proud of her words. But not yet 
satisfied, she turns back and punches him right in the face.

             HANS
      Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

He falls overboard. 

Elsa comes over to Anna and hugs her. Over her shoulder, 
Kristoff meets Annas eyes. She smiles brighter, happy.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ARENDELLE  DAY

Its a beautiful summer day. The mighty ships have been 
repaired and are sailing away. 

On one of the ships, HANS is thrown into a brig.  

             FRENCH DIGNITARY
        (to Kai)
      I will return this scoundrel to his 
      country. We shall see what his 
      twelve big brothers think of his 
      behavior. 

             KAI
      Arendelle thanks you, my Lord. 


  
                                        109

Down on the dock, Arendelle guards lead the Duke and his two 
thugs to their ship. 

             DUKE
      This is unacceptable. I am 
      innocent. Im a victim of fear. 
      Ive been traumatized. 
        (bad acting)
      Ow! My neck hurts. Is there a 
      doctor I could...No? And I demand 
      to see the Queen!

Kai steps down from the gangplank to the dock.

             KAI
      I have a message from the Queen. 
        (reading a scroll)
      Arendelle will henceforth and 
      forever no longer do business of 
      any sort with Weaseltown.

             DUKE
      Weselton. Its Weselton! 

The guards usher him and his thugs onto their ship.
       

EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE  DAY

Anna runs through the crowd, pulling a blindfolded Kristoff 
along behind her. Shes so excited she cant stand it. 

             ANNA
      Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on! 

She runs him right into a pole. 

             KRISTOFF
      Pole.

             ANNA
      Oops. Sorry.

EXT. ARENDELLE DOCKS  DAY

Anna skips to the perfect spot and stops. 

             ANNA
        (stopping)
      Okay. Okay. Here we are.


  
                                        110

She takes off the blindfold. Kristoff opens his eyes. Before 
him sits the most beautiful, suped-up sled. Sven poses in 
front of it -- Vanna White-style. 

             ANNA 
	(contD) 
      I owe you a sled. 

             KRISTOFF
        (blown away)
      Are you serious? 

             ANNA
      Yes. And its the latest model.  

             KRISTOFF
      No. I cant accept this... 

             ANNA
      You have to. No returns. No 
      exchanges. Queens orders. Shes 
      named you the official Arendelle 
      Ice Master and Deliverer.

Sven shows off the Ice-Master-and-Deliverer medal like hes 
king of the bucks. 

             KRISTOFF
      What? Thats not a thing.

But he cant help but admire her enthusiasm.

             ANNA
      Sure it is. And it even has a cup 
      holder.... Do you like it? 

             KRISTOFF
      Like it? 

He sweeps her up high overhead and spins her around. 

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      I love it.... I could kiss you!

He drops her, suddenly embarrassed.  

             KRISTOFF 
	(contD) 
      ...I could. I mean Id like to. 
      Id... may I? We me....I mean, may 
      we? Wait, what?

She gives him a quick kiss on the cheek. 

             ANNA
      We may. 


  
                                        111

He smiles and goes for it. Its a true loves kiss, alright. 

We move past them to find Olaf enjoying the summer.

With his snow cloud safely overhead, hes free to smell the 
flowers, which he does. Then sneezes his carrot nose off. 

Sven catches it between his teeth. Olaf gasps as Sven sucks 
the whole carrot into his mouth. Its gone.

Olafs face sinks in sadness. But not to fear, Sven spits the 
carrot back out and jams it into Olafs face where it 
belongs. Its completely covered in reindeer spit, but Olaf 
doesnt seem to mind. He hugs Sven happily.

                                  CUT TO:

EXT. CASTLE COURTYARD  DAY

The gates to the castle are wide open. In the courtyard, 
stands Elsa. 

             ELSA
      Are you ready? 

Villagers cheer. Elsa stops and creates an ice rink. The 
people, skates at the ready, hope onto it and twirl about. 

Elsa then freezes the fountain in a beautiful design and adds 
some snow flurries for atmosphere. 

Anna comes slipping in. Elsa catches her. 

             ANNA
      I like the open gates.

             ELSA
      We are never closing them again. 

Elsa then waves her hand and magical ice skates (literally 
made of ice) form on Annas boots. 

             ANNA
      What? Oh, Elsa, theyre beautiful, 
      but you know I dont ska--

Elsa grabs Annas hands and pulls her along on the ice. Anna 
slips and slides, but laughs in delight.

Sven goes slipping past. Kristoff runs after him. 

             KRISTOFF
      Look out. Reindeer coming through!


  
                                        112

Olaf skates and helps Elsa coach Anna. 

             OLAF
      Thats it. Glide and pivot and 
      glide and pivot. 

We pull away slowly, into the sky. We arrive at a birds-eye 
view to see that where the castle had crumbled has been 
repaired with a ice. 

All is right in Arendelle.

                           FINAL FADE OUT. 

                 THE END
