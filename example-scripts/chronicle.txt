FROM ANDREWS FIRST CAMERA.

CUT - to indicate time lapses within a scene

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREWS ROOM

The room is dingy.  Unkempt.  The camera sits on the bed, on 
its side, facing the door.  We can hear someone moving around 
off screen.

The door handle clicks; someones trying it.  Then nothing.  
Then, suddenly, loud pounding on the door.

Andrews voice is scratchy and prone to cracking.  He speaks 
with a rushed mix of fear and anxiety.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     What do you want, Im getting ready 
     for school-

             MR. DETMER
	(O.S.)
     Why is the door locked, unlock this 
     fucking door right now.

The bed stirs as Andrew sits down.

             MR. DETMER
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     I said unlock this door.  UNLOCK 
     THE DOOR.  OPEN THE DOOR, NOW.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Youre drunk-

             MR. DETMER
	(O.S.)
     Listen, you dont tell me- IF IM 
     DRUNK, OR-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Its seven thirty.  In the AM.  
     Youre drunk, dad, thats crazy-

             MR. DETMER
	(O.S.)
     Whatre you doing in there.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Im filming this.

             MR. DETMER
	(O.S.)
     What?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I bought a camera.  Im filming all 
     your shit from now on.


                                      2.

Theres a beat, and then we can hear Mr. Detmer moving away 
from the door.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - SANDRA DETMERS ROOM

Equally dingy.  SANDRA DETMER, gaunt and sickly, is sat up in 
bed.  Andrews filming her.  Shes clearly very ill, speaking 
in a weak rasp.  Andrew now holds the camera.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Mom?  Will you say hi to the 
     camera?

             SANDRA DETMER
     Whos the audience?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     The millions of people watching at 
     home.

             SANDRA DETMER
     Hello world.  Do I look awful?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     No, you look great.

             SANDRA DETMER
     Ive been looking a little better, 
     yeah?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Oh yeah, definitely.

             SANDRA DETMER
     Its a nice camera.

EXT. CLARK STREET - MORNING

Clark Street is a slummy mess; dead lawns, potholes in the 
street in a downtrodden suburb of Portland Oregon.  Andrew 
carries the camera loosely at his side before getting into 
the passenger side of a car.

In the drivers seat is MATT Garrety, 17, with messy hair.  
Hes disaffected, and more than a little cynical; the 
reasoned demeanor of an unpretentious high-school 
intellectual.

             MATT
     I got you egg salad.


                                      3.



             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Oh, yeah, thanks.

Theyre driving.

             MATT
     So...Should I ask about the camera, 
     or-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Im filming things now.  Im 
     filming everything.

             MATT
     Youre filming everything.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     For my mom.  Im trying to get 
     custody of her from my dad.  Shes 
     getting worse, and hes 
     not...helping, and this way, in 
     case something goes down-

             MATT
     He gets violent or whatever-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Right, itd be evidence.

             MATT
     Evidence.  But youre not with him 
     right now, but youre filming this.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Well, yeah, to add context.

             MATT
     Context.  Andrew, you are...a weird 
     dude.

             MATT
	(CONTD)
     Did you ever read any Auguste
     Comte?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     What is that?

             MATT
     Hes this philosopher Im reading.


                                      4.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     For school?

             MATT
     Hes just like- his whole thing is 
     about being positive and like, 
     taking up for yourself.  You should 
     read him, maybe, it might make you 
     feel- you know, improve your 
     outlook.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Yeah, right.

EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - PARKING LOT

Andrews getting out of the car, but then ducks back in to 
see Matt lighting a pipe.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Are you not coming in?

             MATT
     Im gonna blaze a little first, 
     yeah?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Youre going to miss first period-

Matt turns on the radio, loud.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     Okay, okay.

INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - HALLWAY

Andrews filming himself putting stuff in his locker, and 
does a quick sweep of the crowded school hallway.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     This is my school, I guess.  This 
     is the hallway-

             GIRL
     Vote Kaz!

A girl suddenly approaches, awkwardly handing Andrew a flyer.

             GIRL
	(CONTD)
     Vote Steve Kazinsky for Senior 
     class president!


                                      5.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     ...yeah-

             GIRL
     Every vote counts.

Andrew films the flyer for a moment, brightly colored and 
featuring a picture of a smiling Steve Kazinsky, before 
something yanks the camera away.

For the first time we see ANDREW Detmer, 17, pale, awkward 
and gangly, with long, stringy hair and thin, scraggly beard.  
He looks anxious, if not afraid.

             BRYCE
	(O.S.)
     Yo this camera is a piece of shit.  
     Its like from 2004 or some shit.

WAYNE, 17, big and hateable in his Ed Hardy T-shirt, appears 
wrapping his arm roughly around Andrew.

             WAYNE
     Hey, how do I look?
        (starts muscle posing)
     Like this?  Ooh, thats good.  Like 
     this?  Thats sexy, right?

             ANDREW
     Bryce, gimme my camera back-

             BRYCE
	(O.S.)
     Fuck you Andrew, shut up.  This 
     cameras a piece of shit.

             WAYNE
     You got me, lets go.

Wayne turns and knocks everything out of Andrews locker.  
Bryce starts to walk away with the camera.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Hey, Bryce, come on, give it back-

The camera is set down on the ground, and then abruptly 
kicked back to Andrew.  He picks it up, checking on it.

             ANDREW
	(CONTD)
        (quietly, sad)
     Oh come on...


                                      6.

EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD

A view from the bleachers as the soccer team practices.  The 
cheerleaders are practicing too.  We cut: a different view, 
lower.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     This is where I eat lunch, out here 
     on the bleachers.

The cameras next to Andrew as hes eating, down on the 
bench.  A CHEERLEADER approaches.



             CHEERLEADER
     Hi.

             ANDREW
     Hey-

             CHEERLEADER
     Could you not videotape us, please?  
     Its really fucking creepy.

             ANDREW
     I wasnt, videotaping you, so much 
     as I was just-

     		CHEERLEADER
	Just dont videotape-

		ANDREW
	-you know, filming what I do 
        during the-

             CHEERLEADER
     Dont videotape us, okay, or well 
     call security.  We see you watching 
     us, were not stupid, and its 
     sketchy, so back off.

             ANDREW
     ...okay.

             CHEERLEADER
     Is it on right now?

             ANDREW
     Yes.

             CHEERLEADER
     Turn it off.

Andrew turns off the camera.


INT. MATTS CAR

Matts driving.  Andrews filming from the passenger seat.

                                      7.

             MATT
     Theres a party tonight.  A barn 
     party at Haven Hills.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I thought Haven Hills was closed.

             MATT
     Its abandoned, yeah.  Thats why 
     its a good place for a party.  Two 
     kegs.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Why are you telling me?

             MATT
     You wanna go?  I dont wanna go 
     alone.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     ...Nah...

             MATT
     When was the last time you went to 
     a party?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I dont like parties.

             MATT
     Youre a senior.  Just come, youll 
     have fun.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Ill think about it.

             MATT
     Okay, right.  Andrew, can I give 
     you like, a pro tip?

             ANDREW
     Yeah?

             MATT
     Keep the camera at home.  Its 
     weird.

             ANDREW
     It has a purpose-


             MATT
     Im trying to be a good cousin, 
     here.  This is me being your 
     friend, yeah?  Okay?

                                      8.

EXT. DETMER RESIDENCE

Andrew is filming as he walks along towards his house.

             HOWARD
	(O.S.)
     Hey, what you doing?

             COSTLY
	(O.S.)
     Hey nice camera bitch, gimme your 
     fuckin camera!

The camera pans up to reveal HOWARD and COSTLY, moron 
hoodlums, along with several friends, over by a car on the 
other side of the road, drinking forties.

             HOWARD
     Hey dont film me nigga, dont film 
     me.

             COSTLY
     Hey fuck off, you better run to 
     your house, bitch.  Run to your 
     house and lock the door.

Andrew just stands there filming them.  Howard hurls his 
forty at Andrew, who doesnt move; it shatters very near to 
him.

             HOWARD
     The fuck, fuck you faggot-

Howard quickly starts crossing the street, and Andrew turns 
and runs back towards his house.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREWS ROOM

The camera lays on Andrews bed again, filming the room.  
Andrew is on his laptop at a desk, working.

             ANDREW
     Im uploading what I shot 
     today...you have to keep a back-up, 
     you know.

The door suddenly opens, revealing MR. Adrian DETMER, 40s, 
Andrews father.  He doesnt look as white trash as youd 
expect.


                                      9.

Andrew looks up at him, and then goes back to working.  
Detmer goes over to Andrew and slaps him out of his chair.

             MR. DETMER
     When I say open this door, you open 
     this fucking door.

Mr. Detmer leaves, slamming the door on his way out.  Andrew 
sits on the floor in silence.

EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - NIGHT

Were in Matts car, driving on a dark dirt road, past an old 
fence and rusted out farm equipment.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Are you sure its here?
        (beat)
     Are you sure its here, this all 
     looks closed-

             MATT
     Its here, calm down.  Listen.

We can faintly hear party music.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Oh yeah.

EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - BARN

Cars are parked outside a big abandoned barn as Matt and 
Andrew approach.  We see Christmas lights strung up, and 
theres clearly a party going on inside the barn.  Kids are 
milling about outside, too, drinking, fucking around.

             MATT
     Hey dude, dont follow me around 
     all night.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     What?

             MATT
     Dont follow me around all night, 
     okay?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     What am I supposed to do?  I 
     thought you said you didnt want to 
     go alone-


             MATT
     Talk to people?  Have a beer, I 
     dont know.

                                      10.

MONTAGED 
FOOTAGE...

Andrew skulks around the party, which is clearly in full 
swing.  Lots of bad footage of people talking, drinking, 
girls dancing sexy, guys joking around.  Andrew is silent and 
detached, just filming.  He sees a girl, CASEY Letter, 16, 
filming as well.  They shout over the music.

             CASEY
     Hey, what are you filming for?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Oh, I dont- just filming.

             CASEY
     What?  Im filming for my blog!

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     What?

             CASEY
     I have a video blog!  Why are you 
     filming?

Andrew simply backs away.  More footage of the party.  
AUSTIN, 18, in an Ed Hardy shirt, comes out of nowhere.  Hes 
clearly a little drunk.

             AUSTIN
     Hey, were you filming my 
     girlfriend?  Yes or no, were you 
     filming my girlfriend?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     No, I wasnt filming anyone 
     specific, just filming the party.

             AUSTIN
        (beat)
     Okay, good, because I dont wanna 
     have to beat your ass.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Okay.

             AUSTIN
     Dont talk back to me.  Dont get 
     smart, okay, Im being nice here.  
     Im being nice to you.


                                      11.

             AUSTIN
	(CONT'D)
	(O.S.)
        (beat)
     Say okay.

             ANDREW
     Okay-

             AUSTIN
     Cause I know you were filming my 
     girlfriend dancing.  I should break 
     your fucking nose, you know that?  
     You know that, I should beat your 
     ass right now, but Im trying to be 
     nice.  Fuck you.

Austin abruptly throws his beer on Andrew, getting some on 
the camera, and then spits on him.  Andrew backs up, shocked, 
lowering the camera.

EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - EDGE OF THE WOODS

Andrews out alone in a field now, furiously cleaning the 
lens of the camera, obstructing our view.  Cut to a few 
moments later; the camera now resting in his lap or on the 
ground.  We can see the barn, the party still going on.

After a few moments, we can faintly hear Andrew crying.

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
        (loud, sudden)
     Are you Andrew?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
        (startled)
     What-

             STEVE
     Are you Andrew-with-the-camera?
        (beat)
     Matts cousin, Matt said you had a 
     camera?

The camera is picked up to reveal STEVE Kaz Kazinksy, 17, 
approachably handsome and in great shape, with an easygoing, 
instantly likeable charisma.

Hes a little drunk and giddy.

             STEVE
	(CONTD)
     Dude, are you okay?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Im Andrew.


                                      12.

             STEVE
     Im Steve Kazinsky-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     No, I know.

             STEVE
     ...yeah?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Everybody knows who you are.

             STEVE
     Haha, yes, that is true.  Listen, 
     come on, bring the camera.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     What?  I dont-

             STEVE
     Come on.

Steve starts off, but Andrew hesitates.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I dont-

             STEVE
     Dude, come on, we found something.

EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - FIELD

Steve is walking ahead in the field of tall grass, toward 
woods.  Its rather dark.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Look, I dont think were supposed 
     to-

             STEVE
     Is there a light on that?  On your 
     camera?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Oh, I dont- Hm, I dont know-

The camera goes down for a moment while Andrew futzes with 
it.  The light clicks on, illuminating Steve.

             STEVE
     Awesome.




Theyve reached the woods, and Steve is climbing over the 
remains of a fence.  The light bounces around wildly.

                                      13.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     What were you guys doing out here?  
     This is way out-

             STEVE
     Me and your cousin were blazing a 
     little.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Matts out here?

             STEVE
     A bunch of people were out here, 
     but I think theyve all gone back, 
     now, cause were like, obsessed 
     with the thing.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     The what?

Theyre in the woods now, thick and dizzying.  Its near 
silent but their feet crushing the Fall leaves on the ground.  
Steve walks out ahead.



             STEVE
     Andrew Detmer, thats right.  I 
     remember you from homeroom, 
     Freshman year.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     You remember that?

             STEVE
     Yeah, I have a memory for faces.  
     Im gonna go into politics, which 
     is ironic because Im soooo fucking 
     high right now- probably shouldnt 
     be letting you videotape this-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Im gonna be so rich when youre 
     president, you have no idea-

             STEVE
     Yeah, video footage of me luring 
     you into the woods for gay sex- 
     wait, hey- HEY, MATT, IS THIS IT?


                                      14.

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     Down here!

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Matt?

The camera turns to reveal Matt, standing next to some kind 
of craggy hole in the ground, at the base of a hill in the 
woods.  Its big, but the darkness beyond is impenetrable to 
the camera.  It looks like a big black spot.

             STEVE
     There we go.  There it is.

Andrew and Steve are now down with Matt by the hole.  Andrew 
is keeping the camera fixed squarely on the murky blackness, 
nervous.



             STEVE
	(V.O.)
     Where is everybody?

             MATT
     They all left.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Were not supposed to be out here.

             STEVE
     Is it still making the sound?

             MATT
     Yeah.  Did you tell Andrew?

             STEVE
     Oh, Andrew, its making a sound-

             MATT
     Here, listen.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Guys-

             STEVE
     Youve got to get really close to 
     hear it.

Andrew takes a tentative step towards the hole.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Guys, just dont like- dont push 
     me, or do anything like that-


                                      15.

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     Youve got to go closer.  Like 
     almost inside it.

Theres a beat.

             MATT
     Were not going to push you, we 
     just wanna get it on tape.

Another pause.  Andrew moves towards the hole.  Even with 
Nightvision, its completely dark in there.  A beat.

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     Do you hear it?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     ...Its like, whispering?

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     Listen.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Singing?

	     MATT
	(O.S.)
	Ooooh shiiiiit-

		STEVE
	(O.S.)
	That is so fucking creepy!

Andrew turns the camera back to Matt and Steve.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     What is that?

             STEVE
     We didnt dig the hole, man.

             MATT
     Is the sound on the camera?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I dont know, probably...I mean, 
     its- its kinda loud, right?

Matt looks to Steve.

             STEVE
     Do you guys wanna go in and have a 
     look, or what-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     No, I dont- I mean, I wont do th-

             STEVE
     Hold your nose.


Steve suddenly goes right into the hole, vanishing into the 
darkness.

                                      16.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Hey, wait-

             STEVE (FROM THE DARK)
        (faintly)
     Come on!

             MATT
     Steve, come on, we dont know if 
     its stable in there- Its probably 
     just the wind, we should-

Andrew abruptly goes into the cave.

             MATT
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     Andrew, hey, come on!  
     Dont...shit.

INT. THE HOLE

Its almost pitch black, but we can hear Andrew breathing.  
Its claustrophobic in here.  Eerily quiet.  The camera 
searches around, but the walls are tight in here, and low.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Hello-

	       STEVE
	(suddenly appearing)
	Im right here.

		ANDREW
	(O.S.)
	Aah!

             ANDREW
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     Does it go down much deeper, or-

             STEVE
     Yeah, really far.  Its not a cave, 
     its like a tunnel- do you hear how 
     loud thats getting?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Do you think it could be like wind, 
     or-

             STEVE
     Come on, man.  Come on.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Then what do you think it is?


                                      17.

             STEVE
     Huh.  I dunno.  I dont believe in 
     ghosts.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Who said anything about ghosts.

Steve laughs, and turns, going back into the darkness.  
Andrew follows.



Matts face is suddenly in front of the camera.

             MATT
     -shouldnt have come in here.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Steves up ahead-

             MATT
     At first I thought this was a 
     solutional cave, but now...I dunno, 
     its like a lava tube, or 
     something.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I dont know what youre talking 
     about.

             MATT
     Look at the walls.  Look at how 
     smooth they are.  Its just 
     straight shot down, I mean, we 
     mustve already gone forty or fifty 
     feet-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Dont talk about it, youre making 
     me nervous.

             MATT
     You ever hear of Platos allegory 
     of the cave?


             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     No.

             MATT
     Nevermind.




                                      18.

Walking.  Darkness.  The cave is even tighter now.  The light 
flickers, some kind of electrical disturbance, then goes out 
completely  We hear Andrew curse, fumbling with it, and the 
nightvision mode comes on.



The nightvision is scrambling badly.  All the forms are 
distorted and then-

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     Can you believe this, this is NUTS-

The nightvision is turned off, revealing Matt.  Theyve come 
into a larger chamber in the cave, one somehow lit from 
within; the boys are bathed in a softly pulsing turquoise 
glow.

They speak loudly, clearly talking over something we cant 
hear.

             MATT
     Is that, is that showing up on the 
     camera?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I dont wanna film it, its messing 
     with the camera-

Matt forcibly turns the camera, to reveal Steve standing next 
to some kind of massive crystalline rock structure growing 
from, or maybe embedded in, the wall.  Around it, and him, 
float wispy little clouds of light, turquoise and beautiful.

Steve is clearly entranced, sweeping his hands through the 
light.

             STEVE
     Touch one!

We see Matt, now also surrounded by the little aurora 
borealis like clouds, touch one; it comes apart in a silent 
little explosion of light, beautiful.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Guys maybe...maybe we shouldnt...

A light cloud passes in front of Andrew, and we sees his hand 
to extend to touch it.  The subsequent little light burst 
badly warps the camera, clearly permanent damage.




Andrew is now very near to the crystalline structure; viewed 
up close, its almost arachnid, organic somehow.  The light 
clouds have turned yellow.  Matt is practically inside the 
structure, pressing it with his palms.

                                      19.

             MATT
     -changes color, see?  It must be 
     reacting to the heat, some kind of 
     exothermic reaction-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     WHAT?  I cant hear you over the- 
     you know-

             STEVE
     Make it change again!  This is 
     awesome!

Matt presses with his palms.  Theres a low sustained hiss as 
the light clouds turn an angry shade of red.  A stream of 
them is released from beneath the structure.  The camera 
jerks suddenly, revealing Steve, whos clutching his ears.

             STEVE
	(CONTD)
     AGHHHHH!

Blood has begun to rapidly pour out of his eyes, ears, mouth 
and nose, and he buckles forwards; the camera spins wildly 
and we see Matt seemingly FLUNG out of the crystalline 
structure.  

It pulses, and seems to rapidly blossom and spread apart, 
revealing a blinding light within which EXPLODES OUTWARD; we 
can suddenly hear an OVERWHELMING CHOIR OF VOICES, and the 
camera sent rocketing backwards, flipping backwards up the 
tunnel-

CRACK.  DIGITAL 
CODE.

BLACK SCREEN.  
HOLD ON BLACK.

FROM ANDREWS SECOND CAMERA.

EXT. MATTS BACKYARD - AFTERNOON

The camera turns on; from the quality of the picture, its 
immediately evident that this is a newer, better camera.  
Its on a tripod, and Matt stands across a well manicured 
backyard; his hair is a little different, time has passed.


                                      20.

             MATT
     Ready?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Rolling, yeah.

             MATT
     Okay, ball test.  Take one.

A baseball comes flying in from behind the camera, nailing 
Matt in the face; he drops like a rock.

             MATT
	(CONTD)
     OW FUCK!  WHAT THE FUCK STEVE!  
     UNDERHAND!

Steve comes in from off camera to help Matt, laughing; we can 
hear Andrew laughing behind the camera, too.

             STEVE
     Im sorry, oh shit, Im sorry-



Now its Steve who stands on the yard.

             STEVE
	(CONTD)
     Go.

A baseball comes in from off camera, slower.  It comes down 
towards Steve, but at the last second makes a bizarre, 
impossible course correction, FLIES UP AND HITS STEVE IN THE 
FACE.

             STEVE
	(CONTD)
     AGH!  HEY, MATT, NOT COOL!

Matt rushes on, doing a victory lap, one hand holding an ice-
pack to his face.  Again, we hear Andrew laughing.

             MATT
     WE ARRREEE THE CHAAAMPIONS-



Andrews out across the yard.  He looks a little better; hes 
gotten rid of the ridiculous nerd beard, and his hair is a 
little better kept.  He nods.

In flies the baseball.  It abruptly stops in the air, a foot 
and a half from Andrews face.  Steve and Matt let out a 
cheer, and the camera is yanked off the tripod, taken to show 
a closer view of the impossibly suspended baseball and 
Andrew.


                                      21.

Andrew smiles, and points to the suspended ball.  A trickle 
of blood comes out of his nose.

             ANDREW
     Ah, shit.



The cameras on a tripod up on the back porch, filming 
Andrew, Steve and Matt standing a triangle.  They are playing 
catch...no hands.  The ball simply flies from guy to guy.  
They drop it a few times in some cuts, but shout 
encouragement, and are clearly having a good time.

Finally, they get the ball going EXTREMELY fast.  Matt looks 
up.

             MATT
     Is-

Matt gets nailed in the balls, and drops as Steve and Andrew 
rush to him, laughing.

             STEVE
     In the- penis- the penis-

             MATT
     I thought I heard my dad...UGHHH
     WHY ME AGAAAAIN!?

INT. MATTS KITCHEN

Steve is very intently using his newfound powers to make a 
peanut butter and jelly sandwich, knife shakily moving over 
bread.  The camera is set down on the counter, Matt and 
Andrew watching.

             ANDREW
     The trick is to pretend like its 
     on a plate.  You get it on the 
     plate and then you wrap the plate 
     around it, and you can move it 
     however you want.

             STEVE
     Mhm.

             MATT
     Ive been pretending I was like, 
     holding it in a fist, like a 
     floating hand.


                                      22.

             ANDREW
     Yeah?  Plates easier for me.

             STEVE
     Guys, check it out.

Steve has a glob of jelly and a glob of peanut butter 
floating freely.  They slap together and then down onto the 
bread, which slaps closed.

             STEVE
	(CONTD)
     Ha!
        (notices his bloody nose)
     Shit, shit-

INT. MATTS ROOM - LATER

Matts room is covered in band posters, kind of a mess.  
Matts sitting on the floor by a desk, slowly assembling a 
LEGO set with his telekinetic abilities.  Andrews filming 
from the bed, where hes laying down.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Try to imagine that your squeezing 
     the entire piece in your hand.

             MATT
     Thats what Im doing, its just, 
     its hard.  Youre better at this 
     than me, you do it.

             ANDREW
        (mocking)
     Really?

Andrew points at the lego set, and it flies together.

             MATT
        (wowed, laughing)
     Dude, holy shit!



Andrew and Matt are laughing as Steve enters, holding out his 
cell phone.

             STEVE
     Guys, listen, listen.  Samantha.

Steve puts his voice-mail on speaker.  SAMANTHA Pezon, 16, 
sounds a bit frustrated.


                                      23.



             SAMANTHA
	(ON PHONE)
     I know youre over at that guy 
     Matts house right now, okay, cause 
     they said you didnt show up for 
     soccer practice, but you said the 
     only reason you couldnt come see 
     Bound By Love with me was because 
     of soccer practice, so...You know, 
     I just, I dont know what to think.  
     I feel like we never hang out 
     anymore, youve just been hanging 
     out with those two guys for the 
     last like three weeks, and I...ugh, 
     call me back.

             STEVE
     What would you suggest, as like, a 
     course of action for me, here?

             MATT
     Why are you asking US for advice on 
     girls?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Because were his mistress.

Steve laughs.

INT. STEVES CAR - NIGHT

Steve is driving Andrew home.

             STEVE
     -new cameras working out for you, 
     thats good.

             STEVE
	(CONTD)
     I have to admit, though, I dont 
     understand the filming thing.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I told you, its just my thing for 
     right now.

             STEVE
     You dont feel like its a little 
     weird?  Like it puts a barrier 
     between you and everything?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Maybe I want a barrier.


                                      24.



             STEVE
     Okay.  I respect that.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     My dad is actually a fireman, or 
     was, I dont know.  He got injured 
     like two years ago, and now they 
     just pay him out of, like, 
     insurance.  He doesnt do anything, 
     I mean he goes out during the day, 
     but I dont know where.  He drinks 
     a lot.

             STEVE
     So how do you pay for your shit?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I do computer repair, and stuff.  I 
     actually make a lot of money...

             STEVE
     What about your mom.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     My mom has spinal meningitis, shes- 
     she cant work or anything, and the 
     insurance doesnt cover all of her 
     medicine, so a lot of my money has 
     to go into that.  I figure if I get 
     enough on camera, maybe I can, I 
     dunno, get custody of her or 
     something.

Steve mulls this over.



             STEVE
     Ive actually been having some 
     problems with my parents, too.

             ANDREW
	(V.O.)
     Yeah?

             STEVE
     Nothing like yours, though.  Not- 
     Never mind.

Theres a long beat.


                                      25.

             STEVE
	(CONTD)
     Theyve just been fighting a lot.  
     I think my mom is cheating on my 
     dad.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     ...Thats intense.

             STEVE
     Yeah.  I know.  Im actually, yeah, 
     Im sure my mom is cheating on my 
     dad.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     How-

             STEVE
     I just, you know, I saw some stuff.  
     Its weird, you dont think about 
     your parents as like...people, or 
     whatever.  I dont know.

The two guys drive in silence.

             STEVE
	(CONTD)
     Dont tell anybody about that-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Haha no of course, no way.

             STEVE
     Good.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREWS ROOM

Its dark.  We can hear shouting from elsewhere in the house; 
useless bitch, carry your ass long enough, etc.  Andrew 
reaches over and turns off the camera.

EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD - BLEACHERS

Matt, Andrew and Steve are eating lunch on the bleachers.

             MATT
     See last night, alone, I got my 
     whole bed off the ground.  No 
     nosebleed.

             STEVE
     Yeah, I was doing weights, too.


                                      26.

             MATT
     Weights, like-

             STEVE
     Free-weights, a barbell.  I got up 
     to two hundred pounds before I 
     bled.

             MATT
     So its, yeah, this is my theory- 
     its like a vagina.  Like its 
     elastic, but if you stretch it too 
     far too quick itll tear-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Ew-

             MATT
     And thats why were getting 
     better.  Were loosening up.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Couldnt that metaphor just be for 
     any muscle in the human body, like 
     working out or-

             STEVE
     No, I like braingina.  Braingina is 
     the shiiiiit.

Steve floats up a bunch of chips from his bag, and then rapid 
fires them into his mouth.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I think its time we took this out 
     of the backyard.

Matt and Steve look confused.

INT. STEVES CAR

Steve is driving, Matts shotgun, Andrews filming from the 
back.

             STEVE
     If anyone criticizes you, just call 
     them a hater. Its like calling 
     someone a racist, theyll just drop 
     whatever theyre complaining about 
     and be like IM NOT A HATER. 
     Nobody wants to be a hater.


                                      27.

EXT. WAL-MART

Matt and Steve are walking in, Andrew lagging behind filming.

             STEVE
	(CONTD)
     Just stay back a little ways, yeah-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I got it.

INT. WAL-MART

The guys are trying to stay out of sight, looking down an 
aisle where shoppers stand.

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     That girl, with the cart.

A frumpy woman with a shopping cart suddenly starts pulling
on the cart. It suddenly breaks away from her, and goes
careening down the aisle by itself, her chasing after it. We
can hear the guys cracking up, trying to stay quiet.

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     Shes chasing- shes chasing it-



Toy aisle. A toddler is looking at teddy bears.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I got this.

One of the teddy bears suddenly comes to life, waving at the 
little boy. The little boy is wowed. The teddy bear suddenly 
takes off and flies through the air. Again the stifled 
laughter.

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     Oh my god Andrew, look-

Andrew pans up to reveal a woman at the end of the aisle; she 
saw everything, and is looking around, wide eyed.



Theyre by the check out.


                                      28.

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     See that guy chewing gum?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Umm...
        (camera finds the guy)
     Got him.

             MATT
     Im gonna get the gum right out of 
     his mouth- watch this.

Theres suddenly a little air ripple in front of the mans 
mouth, and hes yanked face first into the gum and candy 
rack, which all crashes apart. The guys all crack up and 
start running.

             STEVE
        (laughing)
     GUYS, WHY ARE WE RUNNING!?  We 
     dont need to run, we dont need to 
     run!

EXT. FIELD - SUNSET

Matt sits on the hood of a car.  He and Andrew are flinging 
rocks with their powers.

             MATT
     That was a good one, you got that 
     one far.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Hey Matt.
        (beat)
     Do you like me?

             MATT
     What?
        (beat)
     Sure, yeah.  I mean, I didnt, 
     always-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Why not?

             MATT
     Dont get mad, I mean, I like you 
     now, I like you a lot.  Youre 
     just, youre not super easy to talk 
     to.  Youve got a lot of-


                                      29.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Youre an asshole.

             MATT
     See, thats what Im saying.  
     Youre hostile, man.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
        (beat)
     You know, you...If you hadnt 
     invited me to that party, none of 
     this wouldve happened.

             MATT
     Yeah.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Thanks.

Matt laughs.

INT. MATTS CAR - AFTERNOON - WAL-MART PARKING LOT

None of the guys are visible.  Theyre filming a woman park 
her car.

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     I just always feel like I miss 
     stuff.

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     We were just sitting around 
     throwing rocks, it was nothing.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Yeah, until all those chicks showed 
     up.

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     What?  Shut up.

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     Okay, here we go, here we go.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Are you sure theres no one around-

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     Theres no one, I just looked, just 
     go, ready?
        (beat)
     Ready?  



                                      30.

             MATT
	(O.S.) (CONT'D)
     Okay, Andrew, remember, get under 
     it, youre the strongest, Steve get 
     the sides, Ill get the front and 
     back, we gotta do this quick.  
     Countdown.  Three.  Two.  One.  GO.

The car the woman parked shakily lifts off, and immediately 
dips right.

             MATT
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     Steve Steve Steve-

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     Got it, got it.

Silence, and we watch as the car gets to about twelve feet in 
the air, makes a full 180 degree rotation, and then wobbles 
through the air over to a spot several spaces away, and then 
sets down, neatly in place.

    		STEVE
	(CONTD)
	FUCK YEAH!  BOOYAH!

		MATT
	(O.S.)
	YES!  FUCK YES!  OH SHIT, 
        blood-

EXT. WAL-MART - PARKING LOT - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

Matt is sitting against the car with a wad of kleenex on his 
nose, soaked with blood.  Steve is leaning nearby, with a 
brown paper napkin.

             MATT
        (beat)
     My braingina is having like 
     a...face period.

             STEVE
     Yeah, you got some from your ears, 
     too.  Youve gotta start working it 
     out more, Matt.

             MATT
     Yeah man, in between my yoga.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     You just need focus, Matt.

             MATT
     Ha.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Youre lucky you got the kleenex, 
     Im stuck with the taco bell 
     wrapper.


                                      31.

Andrew holds out said wrapper in front of the camera.

             MATT
     Thats like, at least twice as much 
     blood as I usually see on a taco 
     bell wrapper.

             STEVE
     Guys, guys.  Look.

The camera moves around to show the woman returning to the 
space where her car was parked.  She stops, baffled, and 
looks around.  We hear the guys stifle laughter.

She notices her car parked up ahead and walks over to it, 
looking around.  Andrew tries to get a better angle, and she 
notices him, and stares.

             STEVE
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     Ignore us!

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     Were
        (beat)
     Mormons!

The woman stares a moment longer, and goes to her car.

INT. MATTS CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Matts driving, Steves shotgun, Andrew filming from the 
back.  Its raining.

             MATT
     -sfucking insane, we just changed 
     her life.  We did-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Her face, I cant get her face out 
     of my head.

             STEVE
     That was fucking great.  I mean, 
     this just gives me so many ideas, 
     already, stuff we could do-

Theres honking from outside.

             MATT
     Oh come on, what is this?


                                      32.

             STEVE
     Hes like right on your bumper, 
     too.

Matt rolls down the window and gives the signal to pass.  
More honking.

             MATT
     Can you fucking believe this guy?

             STEVE
     Hes just some asshole redneck, 
     look at him.  Hes fucking with us.

They are driving out over a bridge in the woods.

             MATT
     I dont know what to do, what 
     should I-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
        (laughing)
     Here, take the camera, take the 
     camera.

He hands off the camera to Steve; now we see Andrew sitting 
in the back seat.  Behind him, through the back window, we 
can see a pick-up truck, honking, way too close.

             ANDREW
	(CONTD)
     Abracadabra.

Andrew flicks his hand at the truck.  The effect is 
instantaneous: THE FRONT OF THE TRUCK CAVES IN LIKE IT JUST 
HIT A BRICK WALL, WHAM, AND SENDING IT CRASHING OFF THE 
BRIDGE, OUT AND DOWN AND INTO THE WATER.

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     ...I...what...

EXT. THE BRIDGE

The camera is being held loosely at Steves side; 
everythings upside-down, and we cant see anything, but can 
hear the guys are clearly freaked out.

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     What the fuck did you do, man, what 
     the fuck-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I didnt mean to, I didnt-


                                      33.

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     Fuck!  SHIT!  Whats wrong with 
     you, look at this, fuck!

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     Is he still in there?  If hes in 
     there we have to get him out-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Guys, just calm down, Im sorry, 
     okay-

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     Fuck that, take your fucking
     camera.

The camera is shoved to Andrews chest, and lingers there a 
moment before he brings it up to show a view off the bridge; 
the truck is already sinking in the water fifteen or so feet 
below.  We tilt up to see Steve taking off his jacket.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     You dont have to- I mean I can-

Andrew raises out a hand, trying to telekinetically lift the 
car.  It rattles, and then Andrew groans in pain.

             MATT
     Andrew, just stop, just stop doing 
     things.

Steve dives off the side of the bridge.  Andrew films him for 
a moment, swimming to the car.

INT. MATTS CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Andrews filming Matt, who looks angry as he drives very 
quickly.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Are you mad?

             MATT
     Stop, just stop.

EXT. RIVER SIDE ROAD

Matt and Andrew pull up to see Steve dragging the REDNECK 
ASSHOLE out of the water.  They hurry out of the car.




Steve has the guy on the shore.  Hes dazed and bleeding.

                                      34.

             REDNECK ASSHOLE
     -what happened, cause...I dont 
     know....my truck, my truck...

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Is he okay?

Steve just stares directly at Andrew.  Andrew pans to reveal 
Matt, on a cell phone.

             MATT
     Yes, just past White Crescent 
     bridge.  Down by the- yes-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Is that the cops, are you calling 
     the cops?

             MATT
        (ignoring him)
     Yeah, just come- no, I dont know.  
     I dont know, maybe internal 
     bleeding, or-

Later.  The cops and an ambulance have arrived.  An officer 
is talking to Matt, Steve and Andrew; the camera is held low.



             LOCAL OFFICER
     -looks like hell be okay.  Lucky 
     you guys were here.  Is that on?  
     You can go ahead and turn that off.

The camera shuts off.

EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Matt looks FURIOUS, while Steve just looks uncomfortable and 
freaked out.  Matts car is parked nearby.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I dont see how you guys can be so 
     angry-

             MATT
     You dont see how we can be angry?  
     You put a man in the hospital for 
     fucksakes.  You put a man in the 
     hospital, you hurt somebody-


                                      35.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     He was being an asshole- he- I 
     didnt mean to-

             MATT
     Which part of that do you mean, do 
     you mean he was being an asshole, 
     or was it an accident?  Was it an 
     accident, Andrew, cause youre the 
     strongest.  Listen, with this, we 
     cant fuck around, ever.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Then whatve we been doing, weve 
     been fucking around-

             MATT
     NOT LIKE THAT, ANDREW.  Thats- you 
     cant use it on people, or hurt 
     people like- Steve, help me out.

Steve seems lost for words.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I-

             MATT
     We need rules, okay.  Rule #1, you 
     cant use it on living things.  
     Rule #2, you cant use it when 
     youre angry-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     You cant just declare rules, 
     youre not-

             MATT
     I will fucking declare rules, okay?  
     If we keep going, and getting 
     stronger, we need rules.  We need 
     rules.
        (beat)
     Damn it Andrew turn off the cam-

                             SNAP TO BLACK.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREWS ROOM

Its morning.  The camera lays on the bed.  Andrew can be 
heard breathing. 




                                      36.

The camera moves, and is picked up, following a spider as it 
moves across the floor.  It crawls up onto the side of the 
bed, then onto the sheets.  Andrews finger points at it.

The spider is telekinetically lifted into the air.  It hangs 
struggling there for a moment, then becomes rigid.

He spreads his fingers, and the spider abruptly separates 
into all of its component parts. They stop moving, hanging 
lifeless.

Andrews home phone rings, and he drops the spider.  Rings 
again.

             MR. DETMER
	(O.S.)
        (from downstairs)
     Andrew!  Answer the fucking phone!

INT. MATTS CAR - STEVES STREET

Andrews filming Matt from shotgun.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Did he say what it was about?  When 
     he called, what did he say?

Matts quiet.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     Are you still mad at me?

             MATT
     Im not mad.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
        (beat)
     You seem mad.

             MATT
     ...Power corrupts, is all Im 
     saying, man.

             ANDREW
     What does that even mean?

             MATT
     I just mean that we have to think 
     about things more now, okay?  We 
     cant just DO things, we have to 
     think first.

             ANDREW
     ...I understand.


                                      37.

             MATT
     Its just- nah, nevermind, were 
     here.

EXT. STEVES HOUSE - MORNING

The house is big and nice, somewhat isolated.  Matt is 
walking up ahead of Andrew to the door.

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     Hey kids.

Matt stops, and both Matt and Andrew look around.

             MATT
     Steve?  Where are you?

Steve is atop a power line pole, thirty feet in the air.  
Andrew and Matt look up at him from the ground.



             STEVE
     Just try it, its easy.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     That doesnt look easy.

             STEVE
     You throw yourself at the ground.  
     You just fall, and catch yourself, 
     and then its easy, I swear.  Dont 
     try to jump or youll flip 
     yourself.

Matt hurls himself at the ground, WHAM.  Cut, and again, 
WHAM.  Cut, and this time he flips himself BAM WHAM.



             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Let me try-

             MATT
     Yeah.  Im done for now.

Matts now holding the camera, showing Andrew.  He checks the 
street for cars.

             MATT
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     No cars, no cars, go.




                                      38.

Andrew throws himself forward.  And stops, hanging in mid 
air.

             ANDREW
     Whoaaaamygod...whoaaa...

Matt moves in for a closer look at floating Andrew, and gives 
a glance up at Steve, whos cheering on the telephone pole.

             MATT
     HOLY SHIT DUDE!  HOLY SHIT, DUDE, 
     HOLY SHIT!  HOLY...SHIT DUDE, HOLY 
     SH-



EXT. SKY

At first its not clear what were looking at, just blue sky.  
Wind is very loud.  The camera pans down to reveal were FIVE 
THOUSAND FEET IN THE AIR, in a clearing between two larger 
cloudbanks.

The camera pans all the way down to show Andrews dangling 
feet, and below them, the impossibly far drop.  We can hear 
Andrew laugh.

We can see Steve and Matt, nearby, now wearing winter-coats 
and hats to keep warm.  Theyre playing catch with a 
football.  Steve tosses it to Andrew, who actually goes into 
a short dive to catch it.  He looks up to see Steve and Matt 
distantly cheering and waving their approval.



Steves holding the camera, filming Andrew attempting a few 
fancy moves, but hes a clumsy flier.  Matt does a few neater 
tricks in some clips.



             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     Hey Matt, youre finally good at 
     something!

             MATT
        (loud)
     What?  The wind!

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     I said youre an idiot!

Matt gives the thumbs up, and Steve laughs.


             MATT
     Its about aerodynamics!  If I put 
     a barrier just in front of me, I 
     can go way faster, cause it cuts 
     wind resistance!

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     I cant hear a damn thing youre 
     saying!

             MATT
     Yeah!  Definitely!

                                      39.



Steve and Matt are seen flying around, Steve further away, 
near a large cloud bank.  Matt is using his abilities to 
shape cloud fluff into an M.  There is a humming, rattling 
sound, slightly audible even over the deafening wind.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Guys, do you hear that?

Neither of the guys can hear him.  Steve however stops in the 
distance, looking around.  He shouts something, inaudible.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     What?  I cant hear you!

Steve pantomimes, pointing at his ear and shrugging.

A BOEING 737 BLOWS OUT OF THE CLOUDBANK BEHIND STEVE. Hes 
spun like a top in its wake, and drops like a rock.

Suddenly were launched downwards, and after a moment, the 
camera disconnects from Andrew, and we see him zooming ahead.

The camera, in free-fall, spins wildly, then suddenly it 
swims through the air dizzily and lands relatively gently in 
some tall grass.  Less than a second later, Andrew and Steve 
come falling down into the grass and roll roughly, splitting 
apart.

They lay there, breathing hard.  Andrew sits up, coughing; 
his eyes, nose and mouth bleeding.  Steve suddenly leaps up.

             STEVE
     WOO!  HOLY FUCKING FUCK!  I COULDA
     DIED, MAN!  I ALMOST FUCKING DIED!

Steve grabs Andrew, shaking and hugging him.


                                      40.

             STEVE
	(CONTD)
     You saved my life, dude!  Andrew, 
     you saved my fucking life!  Is that- 
     Holy shit is that the camera?!  You 
     caught me AND THE CAMERA!?

             ANDREW
        (exhausted)
     Y- yeah-

             STEVE
     FUCKIN AMAZING!

Matt touches down behind them, frantic.

             MATT
     What happened, are you-

             STEVE
     Ahhhhh!

Steve joy-tackles Matt to the ground.

             MATT
        (laughing)
     What the hell, what the hell-

Andrew, laughing tiredly, rolls over and grabs the camera.

Theyre all standing in the field; Steve is still wigging 
out.



             STEVE
     This is what people have wanted 
     forever, since like caveman times!  
     Do you understand, I mean do you- 
     jesus christ, I cant even- 
     Everything is fucking great!  I CAN 
     FLY!  Matt, listen, just say it!

             MATT
     ...I can fly.

             STEVE
     Shout it out man!

             MATT
     I CAN FLY.
        (realizes it feels good)
     I CAN FLY!

Matt stands, shouting out at the field.


             MATT
	(CONTD)
     I CAN FUCKING FLY!

Andrew cheers from behind the camera, and Steve laughs.

                                      41.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I CAN FLY!

             STEVE
     FUCK.  YES.

HOLD ON BLACK 
FOR A MOMENT.

EXT. STEVES HOUSE - POOL - NIGHT

Steve, Matt and Andrew are sitting around the pool outside of 
Steves house; empty beers are all around.  All three are at 
least tipsy.

Matt is up.

             MATT
     Yo Andrew, Andrew, gimme a beat.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
        (flatly)
     No.

All three crack up.

             MATT
     Thats cold, youre so cold!  MY 
     OWN COUSIN!  DJ Steve, dial me up-

Steve immediately starts beatboxing.

             MATT
	(CONTD)
     Okay, yo, yeah, yo, you say you 
     wanna get high you aint high as 
     me, you chillin at yo moms house

     airlines, my DJ is senior class,

     bitches, Im the young Clark Kent.


Steve and Andrew cheer and Matt takes a bow.

                                      42.



The guys have broken open glowsticks, and Steve is filming as 
Andrew and Matt manipulate snakes of the glowing fluid at 
each other; its beautiful.



We cut between three sing alongs; Shake That by Nate Dogg
and Eminem (which Andrew protests too, as he doesnt know the 
lyrics), How You Remind Me by Nickelback, and Macho Man 
by The Village People.

INT. STEVES HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

The guys are in that sleepy mode, now.  Andrews filming, but 
not really focusing on anything.  Matts sprawled out on a 
couch opposite him.  Steves in a chair nearby.

             MATT
     But how does she not notice?

             STEVE
     Well, I mean, she notices that its 
     gotten better, definitely.  You 
     just have to be subtle.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Thats so cool.  Doesnt that count 
     as breaking rule #1 though?

             STEVE
     Pfff, technicalities.

             MATT
     Man, I havent had sex since 
     like...a year.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I havent had sex since ever.

             STEVE
     Ugh, man, you guys...how are you so 
     cool?

             MATT
     Liquid nitrogen.




Later.  Drowsier.  Lights coming from the TV.  The camera is 
laying haphazardly on Andrew.  Theyre all nearly asleep, 
drowsy drunk.

                                      43.

             MATT
	(CONTD)
     Hey guys, are you up?

             STEVE
             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Yeah.
     YO.

             MATT
     Today was like...the best day of my 
     life.  Like I was thinking and I 
     cant think of any day I liked 
     better than today.

Theres a silence.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Yeah.

             STEVE
     Unanimous.  Yes.

             MATT
     Okay...good.

Beat.  Silence.

EXT. HAVEN HILLS FARM - THE CLEARING - MORNING

Time has passed; maybe two weeks.  Its early.  The hole is 
clearly caved in; the entire area is slumped downwards.

             STEVE
     Well that answers that.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I feel stupid now that I was scared 
     to come back.

             MATT
     Nah man, we were all- I mean, I 
     was, definitely, yeah.

A POLICE OFFICER appears.

             POLICE OFFICER
     Hey, you kids cant be here, okay?  
     You gotta move on out.


                                      44.

             MATT
     What?

             POLICE OFFICER
     The ground is unstable, were 
     cordoning the whole place off.

INT. DINER - MORNING

Steve is filming Andrew and Matt across the table.

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     Im live on scene here with Matt 
     and Andrew, boys, can you tell us 
     whats happening?

             ANDREW
     Well, uh, it would appear that a 
     Virgin Mary has appeared in the 
     maple syrup on a young local mans 
     pancake.

             MATT
     In a second it will, wait...

Matt focuses, and we see his syrup form a Virgin Mary.

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     That is, that is some very uh, 
     definitely supernatural shit, going 
     on there.



             MATT
     Well, when I was really little, I 
     wanted to be police officer.

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     Oh, no shit?

             ANDREW
     Fuck you, pig.

             MATT
     No, I just really got into on the 
     idea of altruism, you know?

             ANDREW
     Whats that mean?


                                      45.

             MATT
     Like making things better for 
     everyone.

             ANDREW
     So what, you wanna do like, a 
     charity?  Thats lame.

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     Why is that lame?

             ANDREW
     I dunno.

             MATT
     I mean, Im not gonna- it doesnt 
     matter, you know.  Im never gonna
     get out of this piece of shit town.  
     You know, were all just little 
     pieces.  One person cant really 
     make a difference.  I used to think- 
     I dont know.  I dont know.

Matt telekinetically lifts a spoon and rockets it at the 
camera; it plinks off.

             STEVE
     AAH!  DOUCHEBAG!

Now Matt has the camera, filming Steve.



             MATT
	(O.S.)
     So whats it feel like to be good 
     at everything?

             STEVE
     Im not good at everything-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Name something youre bad at.

             STEVE
     Im not GOOD at everything, I just 
     do my best at everything.  Thats 
     what its about.  I mean you talk 
     about philosophy and shit all the 
     time, but you never really do 
     anything.  Have you even applied to 
     colleges yet?

             MATT
     Ill get to it-


                                      46.

             STEVE
     You could use some of that, man, 
     Im just saying.

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     Oh yeah?  Well you could use some 
     shut the fuck up.

             STEVE
     You lack initiative.

             MATT
     You lack...a dick.

EXT. ROAD - LATER

The guys are walking along.  Andrews holding the camera 
loosely, not really caring, theyre chatting, its chill.  
Matt gets a text.

             MATT
     Shit man, I got my moms birthday, 
     I gotta go.

             ANDREW
     Say hi for me.

             STEVE
     Later dude.

Matt turns and casually rockets off into the sky.

             STEVE
	(CONTD)
     Whatre you doing, where are you 
     going now?

             ANDREW
     Well I dont wanna go home yet.  
     You wanna go into the city?

             STEVE
     Ah, dude, its rush hour.

             ANDREW
     So?

Theres a beat, and then Steve laughs.

             STEVE
     Hell yeah, dude.


EXT. PORTLAND - THE ROOF OF THE KOIN CENTER - SUNSET

Theyre 46 stories up, chillin with milkshakes.  Its 
fucking awesome.  The city is beautiful.

                                      47.

             STEVE
     I wish I could bring Samantha up 
     here.  Shed love this.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     You still havent told her?

             STEVE
     Nah, no way.  Shed freak out.

             STEVE
	(CONTD)
     Moms like, never home anymore.  I 
     mean, you saw how my dad is, hes 
     just quiet.  Sits around.  I dont 
     know.  And talking to him about it 
     is just pointless.  Hes got 
     nothing to say.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     And its bad, because her pain gets 
     real bad, you know, and we cant 
     afford the good meds anymore.  When 
     I was little it wasnt as bad, but 
     even then dad was still, you know, 
     the way he is.  I dont know.  I 
     dont know anymore.  I dont know 
     how to feel.

             STEVE
     Itll be fine, dude.  Youll figure 
     it out.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I hope so.

             STEVE
     Hey, I wanted to ask you, winter 
     breaks coming up...You wanna do 
     the talent show with me?  Get you 
     out there, you know, meet some new 
     people.




                                      48.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     No, I- I mean, no, thats not- Im 
     really shy, and I dont have any 
     talents, or-

             STEVE
     Yes you do, you have a talent, you 
     have a talent.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
        (getting it)
     ...Oh, no way.  No way-

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - SANDRA DETMERS ROOM

Sandras in bed, sicker than ever.

             SANDRA DETMER
     You look handsome.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Yeah, Steve chose my clothes, hes 
     gonna do my hair.

             SANDRA DETMER
     Im glad you are spending so much 
     time with your friends.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Oh yeah, me too.

Andrews camera is down at his side.



             MR. DETMER
	(O.S.)
     -getting to school?

             ANDREW
     I dont know what you mean-

             MR. DETMER
	(O.S.)
     Dont bullshit me idiot.  Matt 
     doesnt come, he dont drive up.  
     You leave the house, and who the 
     fuck is giving you rides to school?

             ANDREW
     Matt.


                                      49.

             MR. DETMER
     No, wrong.  Somethings fucking
     going on with you, you cant hide 
     it.  Think you can slink around, 
     sneaking- sneaking around the 
     house, smiling, I know your shit.  
     And we aint got no more fucking
     money for your mothers pain 
     medication, either.

             ANDREW
     ...Im sorry, Ill try to-

             MR. DETMER
     Sorry isnt good enough, fuck up!  
     Youre a fuck up.  You fuck
     everything up.  Put that fucking
     camera away-

INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - AUDITORIUM

At first, its just a shot off Matts feet, the camera 
pointing down, and we can hear hub-bub all around.  It goes 
to nightvision for a moment, then over-exposes, then back to 
normal.

             MATT
	(O.S.)
        (grumbling)
     Fuck...the stupid...

The camera is levelled, showing a high-school auditoriums 
stage.  A group of kids are playing screamo music.  Cut, a 
little later.  A girl is singing.  Cut.  Casey, the girl with 
the videoblog from the barn party, is doing hip-hop booty 
dancing.  Shes good.  The camera lingers on her.

             MATT
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     ...sfuckin awesome...



Its a few minutes later.  Techno-Syndrome (MORTAL KOMBAT!) 
begins to play.  Theres a beat, and then Steve, in a tuxedo, 
rushes out onto stage.  The applause is DEAFENING, girls 
screaming, etc.

He raises his hands for silence, and then presents Andrew, 
also in a tuxedo.  Mixed reaction from the crowd.  Andrews 
carrying a deck of cards; he fumbles them, they spill onto 
the floor.  Audience laughter; Steve throws up his arms in 
exasperation.


                                      50.

Andrew shrugs, and all the cards leap back up into his hands.  
Theres a beat, and then the audience goes APESHIT.

             MATT
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     Yes!  Fuck yes!



Andrew is juggling, six balls at once.  Steve is drinking a 
soda, and offers Andrew the soda.  Andrew is annoyed.  Steve 
pantomimes joy at not having to give up his soda.  Andrew 
stops juggling, leaving all the balls hanging in the air, and 
snatches away Steves soda.

Steve lunges after him and gets back his soda, only to have 
all the balls drop out of the air and hit him.  The audience 
is LOSING THEIR FREAKING MINDS.



People around Matt are buzzing about how awesome it is.

Andrew is transporting buckets of water across the stage, 
spilling water everywhere.  Steve is pantomiming anger at the 
shoddy job hes doing.  Andrew pantomimes Well, you try.  
Steve tries, but trips and falls, sending the contents of the 
bucket flying out over the audience-

-only for it to seemingly REWIND back into the bucket! The 
place GOES BERZERK.

Steve and Andrew take their bows to overwhelming cheers, 
separately.  Andrew bows again, and people freak out.  We 
hear Matt cheering behind the camera.



INT. MATTS CAR - NIGHT

Andrews filming from shotgun.

             MATT
     Just amazing dude-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     You really think so-

             MATT
     Are you fucking kidding, Ive never 
     seen a reaction like that in the 
     auditorium, you guys- it was 
     fucking like- it shook the 
     building.  You guys are rockstars.


                                      51.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Yeah, it did- it did feel like 
     that.  All the girls screaming-

             MATT
     Ah, see, heres the first stage of 
     your downfall, hubris.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Whats that?

             MATT
     What?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Whats hubris?

             MATT
     Seriously?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     What seriously, fuck you 
     seriously!

             MATT
        (laughing)
     Im sorry, Im sorry-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Hey Matt.
        (beat)
     Whats seriously mean?

EXT. HOUSE PARTY

Its a house party, raging.  Steves out on the porch with 
his girlfriend SAMANTHA, 16, super hot, of course.

             SAMANTHA
     AAAH ANDREW!

Samantha runs down and embraces Andrew, knocking around the 
camera.


             SAMANTHA
	(CONTD)
     Hi Matt!

             MATT
     Hi Samantha!


             SAMANTHA
     Everybodys freaking out, youve 
     gotta come in here-

                                      52.



We see shots of the house party, which is rocking.  People 
keep coming up to Andrew and telling him That was awesome! 
Or You fucking rock!  Andrew sheepishly acknowledges this.  
Finally, a very hot girl with pink hair and a monroe piercing 
is talking.  This is MONICA, 16.  Shes a little drunk.

             MONICA
     Just fucking amazing.  Magic is so 
     hot.  Do you know, me and my mom, 
     in Vegas, went to a magic show, but 
     they didnt have anything like 
     that.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Yeah, well, we spend a lot of time 
     practicing-

             MONICA
     Do you not remember me, at all?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     What?

             MONICA
     We took American History together.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Oooh, oh yeah, your hair was 
     different; it was blue, right?

             MONICA
     Yeah!

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Monica, yeah-

             MONICA
     Yeah!  Hiiii!

More shots of the party, of Monica talking.  She entreats 
Andrew to join her on a beer-pong team.  A little tipsy, 
Andrew agrees, setting down the camera on a couch.  It lays 
there.  SOME GUY picks it up.




             SOME GUY
     And now, you get a special treat, 
     Im gonna film myself taking a 
     piss.

Matt snatches away the camera from him.

                                      53.



Matts walking around with the camera now he films people 
dancing, talking, a people taking shots.  Casey passes, 
filming for her video blog.  Matts camera follows her, but 
then goes back to Steve, whos cheering on Andrew and Monica, 
who are of course dominating at beer-pong.  But they take 
shots anyway.



             STEVE
        (drunk)
     Matt, you have the camera yeah?  
     You have the camera, cause, dont 
     let him forget the camera, okay?  
     Thats Andrews camera.

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     Right on.

Matt wanders the party; a stoner comes up.

             STONER
     Hey Matt, wanna blaze?

             MATT
	(O.S.)
        (beat)
     No, Im good.  Im just filming for 
     Andrew.

             STONER
     Andrew?  Hes upstairs in the 
     bedroom hooking up with that, 
     whatshername, hair girl.

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     Yeah, Im a little drunk though.  
     Movies!  Makin movies.

The stoner wanders off.

             MATT
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     Im making an experimental film.


EXT. HOUSE PARTY - PORCH

Matt turns the camera around to film himself.

                                      54.

             MATT
     Hey Andrew, hope youre seeing 
     this.  Congratulations, sir.  Im 
     drunk, sorry.  I was really worried 
     about you, like, before everything, 
     but I do feel like...
        (beat)
     I feel like this will get better 
     for you, man.  Im sorry I havent 
     been there for you as much, you 
     know, when we were growing up, 
     because, I know you could be an 
     angry...be an angry dude.  But I 
     love you, you know.  Detmer-Garrety 
     extended family for liffffeeeeee.
        (beat)
     But listen when did I become the 
     one whos...whos out alone filming 
     myself, with the camera-

             CASEY
     Hey Matt.

The camera spins to reveal her, and then immediately drops to 
Matts side.

             CASEY
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     What were you filming?

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     Just a thing, its nothing like- 
     you know, Eye Of The Storm or 
     anything-

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     You watch my blog?

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     I- yeah, a lot of people do.  Ive 
     actually been stalking you since 
     like, sophomore year- sorry, use of 
     the word stalking-

             CASEY
     Stockings are why I love Christmas.  
     You wanna get outta here?  This 
     place is too loud for me.


                                      55.

             MATT
     Yeah, I- YES- yeah, just gotta drop 
     off the cam-

Matt fumbles with the camera, turning it off.

BLACK SCREEN.  
HOLD ON BLACK.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREWS ROOM - MORNING

We can hear it raining hard outside.

The camera is laying on its side on the floor, and turns on 
when Andrew fumbles with it.  Theres screaming from 
downstairs; long and low, real pain sounds.

Andrew drops the camera and rushes out the door.  The camera 
lays on the floor.  Time passes.  

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
        (faintly)
     Mom, its going to be okay, okay?  
     Just try to get through, its going 
     to be okay.

Mr. Detmer enters, and notices the camera.  He reaches down 
and picks it up.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM

In the squalid living room of the Detmer residence.  The 
camera is being held off at an angle by Mr. Detmer, as Andrew 
tries to get it back.  It moves around a bit, so Andrew and 
his father are both on/off screen.

             MR. DETMER
     -think you can fucking use me, 
     youre abusive, youre a fucking 
     user little piece of shit.  I went 
     through your camera.

             ANDREW
     Whatd you...You- whatd you see?

             MR. DETMER
     Just you fucking being a drunk 
     mess, spending my money, drinking 
     with your fucking friends-


                                      56.

             ANDREW
     I didnt spend any of your money, 
     RICHARD-

             MR. DETMER
     Cause I dont have any fucking 
     money to spend, it all goes to 
     school for you, for medication for 
     your mother-

             ANDREW
     School doesnt cost any money, I go 
     to public school you idiot-

             MR. DETMER
     -now we cant afford your mothers 
     pain meds anymore, up there 
     screaming- did you just- what THE 
     FUCK DID YOU JUST CALL ME?  CALL ME 
     A FUCKING IDIOT?

Mr. Detmer hurls the camera directly into Andrews face.  It 
knocks him down and clatters to the floor.

             ANDREW
        (clutching his face)
     You asshole, you fucking crazy 
     asshole-

             MR. DETMER
     GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!  YOURE DONE 
     LIVING HERE, GET OUT!

Detmer rushes up to Andrew and slaps him, and again, and 
again, and again, and WHAM!  Andrew backhands Detmer HARD, 
flooring him.  Andrew turns and picks up the camera, leveling 
it coolly on his father as he tries to stand.

Andrews arm snakes out and grabs Detmer by his throat, 
lifting him easily and slamming him against the wall.

             MR. DETMER
	(CONTD)
     I cant- cant move-

      ANDREW
I COULD CRUSH YOU.  YOU KNOW 
THAT, I CAN FUCKING CRUSH 
YOU.  I CAN KILL YOU WITHOUT 
EVEN FUCKING TOUCHING YOU.

MR. DETMER
Get- off- let me go- youre 
hurting me-


Andrew turns and flings Mr. Detmer into the sofa, which flips 
on the impact.  We can hear Andrews gasping sobs, panicked, 
as he turns, runs out of the house, and LAUNCHES INTO THE 
AIR.


                                      57.

EXT. THE THUNDERSTORM

Andrews just below the clouds, massive dark and ominous 
above him.  Its clearly not safe, rain and wind whipping his 
body, lightning crackling inside the clouds.  We can hear him 
breathing hard.

He touches the bottom of a cloud, and gets a powerful 
electric shock, forcing him to back off a tiny bit.

             STEVE
	(O.S.)
     HEY!  HEY ASSHOLE!

The camera turns, showing Steve, in a rainslicker, flying up 
to meet Andrew.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Wheres Matt?

             STEVE
     We have to get down from here right 
     now, Andrew!  This isnt safe!

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Wheres Matt?

             STEVE
     Hung over, dude!  You should be 
     too!  Lets just-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     No!

             STEVE
     What the fuck are you doing?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Im filming the storm, no ones 
     ever filmed a storm like this up 
     close bef-

             STEVE
     No, were getting the fuck down, 
     now. This is fucking crazy, Andrew- 
     what- what happened to your face?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     ...My dad-

             STEVE
     Your dad fucking beat the shit out 
     you!  Come on, well go to the 
     cops, lets get out of here.  He 
     cant do that Andrew.  


                                      58.

             STEVE
	(CONT'D)
     This is not the way you handle it, 
     well go together, lets go, he 
     cant do that-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     You dont give a shit, stop acting 
     like you care!

             STEVE
     I dont fucking care!?  Youre my 
     best friend, idiot!

             ANDREW
     ...What?

             STEVE
     I hang out with you and Matt 
     practically every fucking day!  You 
     think I talk to anyone else about 
     my parents, or my feelings on shit, 
     are you that fucking insecure?

             ANDREW
        (long beat)
     Im an idiot.  Im sorry Steve, oh 
     god, Im sorry-

             STEVE
     Dude, its okay.  You just need 
     help, okay?

             ANDREW
     Yeah, yes, I dont know what Im 
     doing-

             STEVE
     Itll be fine.  But weve- ...Do 
     you hear that?  I hear...singing.

A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHTNING STRIKES STEVE, BLASTING HIM OUT 
OF THE SKY. The boom of thunder is deafening.

For a moment, all we can see is the stormscape, and then we 
hear Andrews rushed, panicked breathing.

DIGITAL 
DISTORTION TO 
BLACK.

EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

Its a gray, dark day.  A funeral is in progress; were 
filming from within the mourning party.  


                                      59.

A large picture of Steve is on a stand as the priest reads a 
eulogy.  Andrews camera movements are rigid again, tight and 
confined, back to how they were when we first started.

We see Steves mother and father.  His mother is sobbing.  
His father simply looks shellshocked, staring at the casket.  
Steves mother leans on his father, and he pushes her away.  
Theres Samantha, crying uncontrollably.  The camera passes 
Matt...

Whos staring directly at us.

Andrew walks along in the cemetary, filming tombstones.



             MATT
	(O.S.)
     What are you doing?  Filming 
     graves, I dont get it.

The camera looks up at Matt.  Hes keeping his distance.

             MATT
	(CONTD)
     Youre not returning my calls, why 
     arent you returning my calls.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Ive been busy.

             MATT
     No you havent.  Why arent you 
     returning my calls.  Turn off the 
     camera.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     ...No.

             MATT
     Turn off the camera.

             MATT
	(CONTD)
     I had a missed call from you, that 
     morning.  And from Steve.  I 
     listened to your voicemail.  No 
     voicemail from Steve.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I was upset.

Silence.


                                      60.

             MATT
        (long beat)
     How do you get struck by lightning 
     during a storm with no recorded 
     lightning strikes?
        (waits, nothing)
     You can look that up online, you 
     know, they keep track of it.  I 
     looked it up.  Zero.  And they find 
     him out in a field, why would Steve 
     go out in the middle of a field 
     during a lightning storm?

The camera shifts a little.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I dont know-

             MATT
     What?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I dont know-

             MATT
     No, no, you do know, you do know, I 
     think you do know.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I dont.

             MATT
     What happened, Andrew.  Just stop, 
     stop lying to me, and tell me-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Im not lying, I dont know what 
     happened-

             MATT
     I dont believe you, okay!  I dont 
     believe you, I want you to- put the 
     fucking camera down.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     No, why-

             MATT
     Because I want to talk to you.  Put 
     it down- put it down, Andrew, 
     please- put it down, turn it off, 
     put the fucking-


Matt, very upset, suddenly advances on Andrew, trying to pull 
the camera away.  Hes suddenly shoved backwards; Matt 
recovers himself before he falls, staring at Andrew.  The 
camera hangs limply for a moment.

                                      61.

             MATT
	(CONTD)
        (breaking down a little)
     What did you do, Andrew?  What am I 
     supposed to do?  Who am I supposed 
     to tell, about this, man?  Who do I 
     tell?  I mean- I dont, I dont 
     know how Im supposed to- Why wont 
     you just tell me what happened?

The camera and Andrew suddenly launch into the air, rocketing 
away from Matt.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREWS ROOM

The camera is on Andrews dresser, near his mirror.  Andrew 
suddenly appears, holding a kitchen knife.

             ANDREW
        (addressing the camera)
     -wanted to show you what I was 
     talking about.

Andrew takes the camera, and angles it down at his arm.  He 
takes the kitchen knife, and presses the tip into the flesh 
of his wrist.  He drags the blade down hard, all the way to 
his elbow...but no cut appears.  He then violently jabs 
himself several times...but no penetration.

             ANDREW
	(CONTD)
     See, its- I put a little sheet 
     between myself and the knife, and 
     the barrier, the sheet, is too 
     strong.  The knife cant cut it.  I 
     mean like, what Im saying is if I 
     concentrate, I cant be hurt.  I 
     cant be injured.  Because of the 
     little sheet.

EXT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - FOOTBALL FIELD

Andrew sits alone on the bleachers.  The cheerleaders are 
practicing.  The camera zooms in on Samantha.  She sits alone 
on the sidelines, watching numbly.


                                      62.

INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - HALLWAY

Andrew is putting his stuff away in his locker.  Hes 
suddenly shoved into the locker roughly.  The camera turns, 
revealing Wayne walking away.  

The camera scans the mostly empty hallway quickly, then goes 
back to Wayne, now almost twenty feet away.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Hey Wayne!

             WAYNE
     What, you got a probl-

One of Andrews hands flicks out, and Waynes mouth suddenly 
gushes blood.  Wayne screams, falling, and is immediately 
tended to by other students.

INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - BATHROOM STALL

Andrew has laid out three small bloody objects on the back of 
the toilet, and presents each one to the camera one by one.

Theyre Waynes bloody teeth.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     See, this one, I got clean, cause I 
     did a little lasso around the root, 
     but these two, theyre broken cause 
     I think I pulled them from the 
     middle.  Matt was always better at 
     the little, the intricate stuff, he 
     got good at that.  See how broken 
     it is, ugh, sloppy.

INT. BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HIGH - GUIDANCE COUNSELORS OFFICE

Mike FERNANDEZ, 30s, serious but warm, sits across the desk 
from Andrew.  The concern in his voice is very real.

             FERNANDEZ
     Could you put the camera away?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     No, Im filming this.  I film 
     everything.


                                      63.

             FERNANDEZ
     I understand that things have been 
     very hard for you recently, Andrew, 
     but the camera kind of- it 
     alienates a little, you know?

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     What did you want to talk about?

             FERNANDEZ
        (beat)
     Theres concern for your grades, 
     Andrew.  And as far as I know 
     youve yet to apply to any 
     colleges, so-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Its not doable.  Financially, 
     theyre not- I mean, my dad didnt 
     go to college either.

             FERNANDEZ
     Well, yes, but I still think its 
     worth thinking about.  There are 
     three different community colleges 
     locally that offer great programs 
     for-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I dont need college, Mr. 
     Fernandez.

             FERNANDEZ
        (beat)
     I think thats a very close-minded 
     attitude, Andrew.  I know that you 
     come from a difficult background, 
     and I know how horrible the pain 
     can be when you lose a friend.  But 
     I dont think you should let this 
     make you lose hope.  I mean, this 
     is your future.  You dont want to 
     compromise your future.
        (long beat)
     Andrew?

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREWS ROOM

The camera is sitting on the floor.  We can hear screaming 
from downstairs.  Andrew picks up the camera, and goes to the 
mirror, filming himself filming.  After a beat, he steps out 
from behind the camera, leaving it hanging in the air.


                                      64.

He stands looking at himself, and then the camera.  The 
camera turns to face Andrew.  He doesnt look good, but gives 
a weak smile.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - MS. DETMERS ROOM

Were peeking in through the door.  We can see Sandra Detmer 
writhing around in agony in the bed, moaning in pain.  She 
lets out a long scream, and then seems to notice us watching.

             SANDRA DETMER
     Richard is that you?  Richard, you 
     have to let me have my medicine, I 
     cant...Andrew?  Who is that?  
     Look, please come in here, I need 
     help to turn over.  It hurts, 
     please, Andrew, you have to tell 
     your father...tell your father to 
     get my medicine...

Sandra, her eyes closed in pain, is lifted and rolled onto 
her side.

             SANDRA DETMER
	(CONTD)
     Andrew...thank you Andrew...was
     that you?  Did you-

The door closes.

EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT

The junkyard is filled with junked cars, metal garbage, old 
equipment.  The camera sits awkwardly on the hood of a 
wrecked car as Andrew fidgets to get it mounted.  The area is 
lit by lights from the main building, not too far away, but 
you can tell hes not supposed to be in here.



Andrew moves out in front of the camera.  He telekinetically 
pulls an old car forward, and lifts it easily.  He moves it 
left, moves it right, rolls it, sets it back down.



Andrew is sitting, resting, tired.  He speaks directly to the 
camera.


                                      65.

             ANDREW
     Ive been doing a lot of reading, 
     like you know, online, about 
     evolution, and the way it works, 
     and you know, natural selection.  
     The uh...
        (cut)
     The strongest animals will always 
     survive, and theyre the ones that 
     you know, will prosper, or grow, 
     and survive, by feeding on the 
     smaller animals.  And as humans we- 
     see, theres...uh-
        (cut)
     Theres this thing called an Apex 
     Predator, and basically what that 
     is the most powerful predator in an 
     ecosystem.  And humans, you know, 
     were the apex predator, because 
     theres nothing that preys on us, 
     cause of weapons and stuff.  But if 
     something could, I bet it would.  
     I...
        (cut)
     I mean, what Im trying to say is, 
     a lion doesnt feel guilty when it 
     kills a gazelle.  You dont feel 
     guilty when you squash a fly, you 
     know-  I think that means 
     something.  I think it really means 
     something.



Andrews back out with the car.  He lifts it again, then 
makes a quick squeezing motion.  As he does this, the car 
violently compresses down to the size of a basketball.  
Andrew flings the ball of metal into a scrap pile, which 
collapses loudly.

Andrew falls down onto his butt, a little exhausted, but as 
he gets up he is abruptly attacked by a guard dog, which 
bites him twice before hes able to fling it off.

The dog recovers, and rushes Andrew, who raises a hand, 
blasting the dog across the yard, killing it instantly.

Andrew turns and looks at the camera, and it turns off.

FROM CASEYS CAMERA.

Everything is crisper, cleaner, brighter.  Higher resolution.


                                      66.

INT. CASEYS HOUSE - BATHROOM

Were looking at the door to a bathroom, only a crack open.  
Its pushed open, revealing Matt, shirtless, brushing his 
teeth.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     AHHHH!

Casey runs up and hugs Matt from behind, startling him.

INT. CASEYS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

Matt is cooking; hes got four different things on the stove.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     Howd the interviews go?

             MATT
     I told you how the interviews went.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     But now we do it for the camera.

       		MATT
	UGHHHHHH-


		CASEY
	(O.S.)
	Come on.

             MATT
     UCONN not so good, Columbia was 
     good, University of Miami was 
     really good, Arizona State was 
     okay.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     Who ended up paying for all of the 
     airfare?  Did your parents-

             MATT
     Haha, no, I told you they wouldnt.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     Did you pay?

             MATT
     Nope.  Nobody.  I flew myself.  I 
     needed the exercise.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
        (beat)
     You are a man of mystery.

Matt smiles.


                                      67.

             CASEY
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     God, how do you always cook so many 
     things-

Matt snatches the camera away from her, turning it to reveal 
that shes topless; Casey has already covered up with her 
arms.

             CASEY
	(CONTD)
        (running away)
     AAH!  AHH OH MY GOD MATT AAAHHH!

Theyre at the breakfast table.  Matts eating, and Casey, 
filming, is talking between bites.



             CASEY
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     You have to do at least one of your 
     tricks for the camera, though.

             MATT
     I am so sick of being filmed, you 
     have no idea, Casey-

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     No I know, but Im not going to use 
     any of this.  I just want you to do 
     a trick, one of your good ones.

             MATT
     When do your parents get back from 
     Spain?

             CASEY
     A week.

             MATT
        (beat)
     Okay, if you dont film me for one 
     week-

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     Ahhhh-

             MATT
     One week, Ill show you my new 
     trick.  I guarantee you will shit
     bricks.  Yeah?

             CASEY
     ...Ughhhh.


                                      68.

INT. CASEYS HOUSE - CASEYS BEDROOM

Matts asleep in bed on a different day.  Caseys filming 
from next to him.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
        (whispering)
     Im filming you and you dont know.  
     Im terrible.  Im gonna show you 
     this later and youre gonna be like 
     whaaaaaaaaaat!

EXT. CASEYS HOUSE - BACKYARD

Matt runs out ahead of the camera, and does a little shuck-
and-jive boxer dance.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     You ready?

             MATT
     Im ready!

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     Are you sure-

             MATT
     Lets do it!  Woo!

Casey raises a paintball gun out ahead of the camera.  She 
fires.  Matts arm whips out, impossible fast.  He holds up 
the caught paintball.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
        (awed)
     Holy shit, Matt.

             MATT
     COME ON!  BRING IT ON!

Casey fires several more shots, Matt catches them 
effortlessly, then hurls them all into the air.  Mid-air, 
they all pop, some of the paint landing on the camera and 
Casey.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
        (laughing, awed)
     Matt, oh my god, oh my god!


INT. CASEYS HOUSE - CASEYS BEDROOM - NIGHT

Its dark; the camera turns on, then the light, revealing 
Matt, groggy, half awake.

                                      69.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     What happened?

             MATT
     Ughhhh camera...I had that dream 
     again.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     Tell me.

             MATT
     Its like Im...Im not me, Im 
     something else.  And Im out in 
     this...out in space.  And stars are 
     all around me, and Im zooming past 
     them; everything is really like 
     three-D, I can see the shape of the 
     stars.  Im looking for somewhere 
     to sleep, or something, and I see 
     earth, and I go down to earth.  And 
     then...I dont know, just the main 
     part is that Im out and there are 
     the stars and they just look like 
     millions of little points of 
     light...And Steve is there.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     Steve is there?

             MATT
     Yeah but he feels like hes not 
     part of it.  Like hes there 
     separately, inside my head.  Andrew 
     is there too.  I dont know.  Im 
     worried about Andrew.
        (beat, slyly)
     Why dont you put the camera away?

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     Oh yeah?  Whats gonna happen to me 
     if I put the camera away-

             MATT
     Oh I think you know.  I think you 
     know whats going down.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     We could leave the camera on.


                                      70.

             MATT
     You arrrrreeee...Cmere.

Matt advances on Casey, and the camera falls off to the side 
of the bed.  We can hear her giggling, which is abruptly 
muffled by kissing.

DIGITAL 
DISTORTION TO 
BLACK.

EXT. CEMETARY - DAY

The camera is aimed at Steves tombstone.  There are still 
flowers and memorials spread around.  Some are rotting.  The 
camera moves around a little, then back to Steves tombstone.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREWS ROOM - NIGHT

Screaming from Sandras bedroom.  The heater rattling.  The 
TV from downstairs.  Theres a knock on the window.  The 
camera is picked up, to reveal Matt floating outside, looking 
around nervously.

After a moment, Andrew opens the window.

Matt stands fidgeting, clearly uncomfortable, as Andrew films 
him.



             MATT
     You havent been returning my 
     calls, so I thought Id just...you
     know, ambush.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Thats rude.

             MATT
     I just- Ive been getting, you 
     know, bad vibes or whatever.

Andrew is silent.

             MATT
	(CONTD)
     I know you stopped coming to 
     school, and my mom said you guys 
     are having a lot of problems with 
     money.  Im worried about you.


                                      71.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Why?  Your lifes great-

             MATT
     Dude, dont be like that, okay-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     You dont need to worry about me.  
     Im stronger than ever now.  I can 
     lift a whole car by myself.  I 
     could fucking crush this entire 
     house, Im fine.

             MATT
     That doesnt- that actually sounds 
     like the opposite of fine.  Andrew, 
     come on, lets get out of here, 
     your rooms a mess, it smells like 
     a Dennys bathroom in here.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     So what?

             MATT
     Youre my cousin.  Youre my friend- 
     its my responsibility to take care 
     of you.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I think you should go.  I have to 
     pick up my moms medication.

             MATT
     ...Are you going to break the 
     rules?
        (beat)
     Were too strong now, Andrew.  
     Were too strong for that.  If you 
     did that, you know Id have to-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Youd have to what. You were 
     always the weakest.  You couldnt 
     do shit to me.

             MATT
     ...Andrew-

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Im not gonna break your stupid 
     fucking rules, just fuck off and 
     stay out of my life.


                                      72.

Matt stands staring at Andrew.  The camera fidgets 
uncomfortably.  Matt shakes his head, and the camera follows 
him as he goes to the window, gives Andrew one last look, and 
then rockets off into the sky.

The camera sits in silence, pointed at the window.

INT. PHARMACY

The camera approaches the counter.

             PHARMACIST
     Hello, how can I help you.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Im here to pick up a prescription 
     for Sandra Detmer.

             PHARMACIST
     Um, yes, hold on.  Thats Imuran, 
     Baclofen, Glatiramer and Vicodin.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     Thats right.

             PHARMACIST
     Okay, and the copay on that 
     is...Seven hundred and fifteen 
     dollars, eighty three cents.

Silence.

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
     I have to come back.

             PHARMACIST
     Okay, well hold it for you.

INT. DETMER RESIDENCE - ANDREWS ROOM - LATER

Andrew is filming out his window, watching his father leave.  
His stereo plays David Bowie.  Once his dads car is gone, 
Andrew sets down the camera on the dresser opposite the 
mirror, and leaves the room.

Time passes, and Andrew reappears, now dragging a crate.  He 
opens it, and pulls out his fathers firemans uniform.  We 
do short-space time cuts as he takes out the jacket, looks at 
it, and turns it inside out, so that the metallic fireproof 
inner lining is exposed.

Ziggy Stardust comes on Andrews stereo.


                                      73.

Andrew, wearing the jacket, looks at himself in the mirror, 
his back to the camera.  He reaches down, and picks something 
up, looking at it, then pulls it over his head.

Its a gas mask.

He stands there staring at the surreal, hard edged, faceless 
figure in the mirror.  Looks right.  Looks left.  Adjusts the 
mask.  

Then turns and whips out his hand; the camera is abruptly 
yanked across the room.

EXT. RUN-DOWN HOUSE - SUNSET

Its a run-down house in Andrews neighborhood.  The 
streetlights and the setting sun give everything light in 
yellow orange haze.

Howard, Costly, and some other thugs are chilling on the 
porch, laughing loudly, smoking a blunt.  They clearly 
havent noticed Andrew, whos filming from out by the street.

He reaches down, and picks up a rock, then hurls it at the 
house.  It flies up and breaks a window.  Costly, Howard and 
the thugs immediately mobilize, swearing and posturing as 
they rapidly surround Andrew.

He doesnt react.

             HOWARD
     You are about to get fucking 
     stomped, you know that right?  You 
     hear me son?  Come to my house, 
     its late, I dont see any fucking 
     police officers or some shit, I 
     dont know what you you think 
     youre doing throwing shit at my 
     house-

             COSTLY
     No, wait, what the fuck.  What the 
     fuck are you dressed up like that 
     for.  Are you high?

             HOWARD
     Lil Andrews straight up tripping 
     right now, I dont even know, Ima
     give your ass a wake up call-

Howard starts towards Andrew, who raises a hand out in front 
of the camera.  He makes the gun sign.


                                      74.

             HOWARD
	(CONTD)
     Oh you got a gat?  I got a gat too 
     bitch-

Howard starts to pull a gun from the back of his pants. 

             ANDREW
	(O.S.)
        (firing the finger gun)
     Bang.

Howards body abruptly FOLDS BACKWARDS with a sickly loud 
chorus of cracks, and then is FLUNG ASIDE.  The thugs, 
shocked, dont have a second to react before Andrew 
telekinetically BLOWS ONE OF THEM BACKWARDS, sending him 
smashing headfirst through the windshield of his car.

Costly and the remaining thug start running, and the 
remaining thugs legs suddenly flip up out from under him, 
breaking, bending and twisting like a rag doll, before hes 
propelled face first into the ground, WHAM.

Andrew launches into the air, coming down just in front of 
Costly, who skids to a halt.

             COSTLY
     -no, no-

Costly is shoved to the street and ground back and forth as 
though under the weight of a giant thumb, leaving a 
glistening smear of clothes, blood and skin, before he falls 
across the curb.

We can hear the men screaming and groaning in agony, but 
other than that, the night is silent.

Andrew raises a hand, and all of their wallets and loose 
money lift away from them, flying to him.  Theres a beat, 
and then Andrew launches into the air.

EXT. RADIOTOWER - 80 FEET UP - TWILIGHT

Andrew sits under one of the red airplane spotter lights on 
one of the strut supports.  The camera sits nearby, watching 
the expressionless figure as it counts the money.  

Theres a beat and he hangs his head.  We can hear muffled 
noises of frustration from under the mask.  Something that 
sounds like a low, angry scream.

Very suddenly, he dives off the tower. A second later, the 
camera is yanked after him, zooming out into freefall.


                                      75.

EXT. GAS STATION

Andrew, holding the camera, touches down just outside the gas 
station.  He waits a beat, and then starts to walk towards 
it.  We transition to...

FROM GAS STATION SECURITY CAMERAS.

Black and white, a slightly grainy feed, with no audio.

We watch from the camera by the pumps as the bizarre figure 
in the coat and the gas mask, holding the camera out in front 
of it, strides past people pumping gas, into the station 
store.

INT. GAS STATION

The wall mounted security camera shows us the whole store.  
Andrew enters, turning to the clerk behind the register, who 
says something, looking concerned.  Hes suddenly blown out 
of frame.

After a beat, the register rips itself free from the counter, 
and floats over to Andrew.

Andrew turns and walks out, the register floating with him; 
as he does, a second clerk rushes out, panicked, yelling.  He 
goes behind the counter, and grabs a shotgun.

EXT. GAS STATION

Andrew exits the gas station, as does the clerk, who yells, 
raising the shotgun.

Andrew whips an arm out towards him, and the clerk fires as 
hes hit by a wave of energy.  The shotgun blast goes wild, 
striking the stacked tanks of propane next to the garage. 

The effect is instantaneous; a blinding white flash of fire 
envelopes the clerk and floors Andrew, the camera we look 
through jerking awkwardly, the feed breaking down.

FROM ANDREWS SECOND CAMERA.

The camera lays awkwardly on its side, the distorted audio 
from its damaged microphone SUDDEN AND PIERCING.  

Its been flung a good deal away from Andrew, who lays 
motionless, burning.  


                                      76.

The clerk is dead, and a nearby gas station customer is 
horribly injured and screaming.  His gas pump lays on the 
ground, pumping out gas onto the asphalt.

Andrew slowly shifts, unable to move properly, and forces 
himself to roll over.  The fire on his body touches the fire 
on the asphalt, and spreads lightning fast to the gas pump.

The resulting explosion engulfs the entire station.

The camera is spun violently out into the street-

VIOLENT 
DISTORTION AND 
CRASH TO BLACK.

FROM SECURE ROOM VIDEO FEED

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

The camera is color, with crackly, strange, somewhat 
distorted audio.  The image is a little blown out.

Andrew on a bed.  His entire right side is absolutely 
scorched; the flesh looks like bloody, cracked paper, 
blackened and red.  The parts of him that are bandaged are 
already soaked through with blood.  

He is barely breathing, hooked up to various machines.  
Andrew is not going anywhere anytime soon.  This is ensured 
by the handcuff on his left wrist.

The machines beep.  Andrew doesnt move.  The door opens, and 
Mr. Detmer enters, speaking to a POLICE DETECTIVE on the 
other side of the door.

             MR. DETMER
     -come down to the city, cause his 
     mothers all alone right now.  
     Shes got MS, I had to leave her at 
     the house all a fucking alone.

             POLICE DETECTIVE
     I understand, Mr. Detmer.

             MR. DETMER
     Shit.  Jesus, look at this.  Can I 
     have a moment with my son.

             POLICE DETECTIVE
     Yeah I- Ill be outside the door, 
     yeah?


                                      77.

             MR. DETMER
     Okay.

The officer closes the door, and Mr. Detmer goes and sits 
down in a chair next to the bed.  He sits there staring at 
Andrew, clearly horrified and upset, and buries his head in 
his hands.  We SPEED UP THE RECORDING, and Detmer just sits 
like that.  After five minutes of speed up, we slow down.

             MR. DETMER
	(CONTD)
     I want you to apologize to me.

Andrew is comatose.

             MR. DETMER
	(CONTD)
     I said I want you to apologize to 
     me.  I know you can hear me.  So I 
     want you to sit up and apologize to 
     me.  I want you to stop this 
     bullshit right now.

Andrew is comatose.

             MR. DETMER
	(CONTD)
     Do you know how much this shit is 
     going to cost me?  Do you know what 
     youve done to your family?
        (beat)
     You dont even care, do you?  You 
     just dont give a fuck, youve got 
     your fucking morphine, dont you.

Theres a beat, and then Detmer suddenly slaps Andrews burnt 
shoulder.  Andrew flinches badly, and his pulse speeds up on 
the monitor.

             MR. DETMER
	(CONTD)
     Stop it.  Im not buying this shit, 
     you cant just play this off like a 
     fucking
        (slap)
     Game, this is real.  You really 
     fucked me, me and your mother you 
     know that, you little
        (slap)
     Shit.

Andrew no longer flinches, but the slaps leave red, bleeding 
molten welts.  Detmer stands up, clearly upset, and takes a 
quick pace forward and back.

             MR. DETMER
	(CONTD)
     Goddamn it, goddamn it!-


                                      78.

Detmer goes to slap Andrew again, and Andrews arm jerks up.  
Mr. Detmer floats is telekinetically lifted into the air.  

He hangs screaming and struggling for a moment, then becomes 
rigid.

Andrew spreads his fingers, and his father abruptly separates 
into all of his component parts.  

They stop moving, hanging lifeless, then drop to the ground 
in a bloody mess.

Andrews eyes open, revealing black-red eightball
hemorrhages, and he seizes badly, letting out  a scream of 
agony, and then another, tearing at his IV.  

The police detectives rush the room, reacting with horror to 
the gore that was Andrews father.  They barely have time to 
scream out when Andrew snaps his cuff free of the bed, and 
lets out AN ENORMOUS CONCUSSIVE BLAST, blowing apart 
everything in the room including the camera.

                             SMASH CUT TO:

FROM CASEYS CAMERA.

INT. CASEYS HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

All of Caseys family is present, along with lots of little 
kids.  Everyones gathered around Caseys little brother, 
whos being presented with a birthday cake.  Matt looks 
happy.

             EVERYONE
     -appy birthday to you!

Everyone lets out a cheer, including Casey, but then she 
notices Matt abruptly duck out.  She follows him to the 
bathroom...



...where hes holding his nose, which is bleeding badly.

             CASEY
     Matt-

             MATT
     Do you hear that, how can you not 
     hear that?


In the background, we can hear the house phone ring.  Then 
cell phones.

                                      79.

             CASEY
     Matt, what hap-

             MATT
     The singing, how can you not hear 
     that!?  Somethings wrong, okay, 
     somethings wrong with Andrew, or-

             CASEY
     Matt, please, okay, youre scaring 
     me, are you okay-

             MATT
     No, somethings wrong, somethings 
     wrong.

Matt pushes past her, running upstairs.  Casey starts to 
follow, but then stops, lowering the camera.

             CASEYS MOM
	(O.S.)
     Casey, you have to come in here.

             CASEY
     Mom, Matt is-

             CASEYS MOM
     Come in here right now.  Come in 
     here right now.

Caseys filming the big screen TV, which is showing the news.



             REPORTER
     -going to have a feed live on the 
     scene in the second, we apologize 
     for the delay but as of right now 
     every news helicopter in the 
     greater Multnomah County is headed 
     to Portland- again, right now we 
     have very little information, but 
     the word is that the bombings 
     started just over nine minutes ago, 
     and havent subsided yet, with- 
     okay, heres the feed from NBC 
     Chopper 5.

We get a helicopter view from over downtown Portland, 
everything seems okay, and then something streaks by, 
crashing headlong into the side of a building.  


                                      80.

The impact is like a wrecking ball, office furniture blowing 
out into the air along with glass, steel and concrete, WHAM.

             FIELD REPORTER
	(O.S.)
     Wait, that was- that was not a bomb- 
     I repeat, not bombings, its 
     something else-

The camera turns as Matt rushes down the stairs, now in his 
winter parka, his nose plugged with kleenex.  We hear another 
of those jarring, shattering impacts, and the camera goes 
back to the TV, revealing the big MADE IN OREGON sign in Old 
Town toppling down into the street.

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     I need your car.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     What?  Matt, look, whats 
     happening, look at whats happening-

             MATT
     I see, I know, I have to go, okay-

             CASEY
	(V.O.)
     Dont leave, dont leave me-

             MATT
     Give me your keys.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     I- Matt-

EXT. CASEYS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

Casey is chasing Matt across the lawn to her car, her voice 
filling with panic, the camera being held offhanded now, 
unimportant.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     Please dont leave, dont go-

We hear helicopters pass low overhead.

             MATT
     I have to go to the city.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     NO MATT PLEASE, PLEASE-


                                      81.

             MATT
     I cant fly if there are all these 
     helicopters in the air, I just have 
     to drive there, or, listen, I have 
     to figure this out, Andrews in 
     trouble.  This is my fault.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     Andrew?  What are you talking ab-

Matt gets in the car and starts it.  Caseys breaking down, 
openly crying now.

             CASEY
	(O.S.) (CONTD)
     Matt please!  MATT PLEASE, PLEASE 
     DONT GO, IM AFRAID!  MATT IM 
     SCARED, PLEASE!

INT. CASEYS CAR - MOMENTS LATER

Caseys sitting shotgun as Matt drives.  His face is 
unreadable.  Theyre driving on the I-5.  More helicopters.  
Downtown Portland is visible now, as are some fires.

Casey is quietly crying, the camera held loosely in her lap.

             MATT
     This is all my fault.

             CASEY
     No!  No it isnt!  It isnt your 
     fault!

We hear and see the lights of ambulances and police cars as 
they zoom past, but Casey keeps the camera on Matt.

             CASEY
	(CONTD)
     Matt, its not safe.  Its not 
     safe.  Whats going on.  Whats 
     happening.  Why are we doing this, 
     Matt, please.  Please take me home.  
     You dont have your license, you 
     cant drive without your license.

Theyre getting into downtown now.  We can hear sirens.  
Casey is filming out the window, everything looks normal, 
until theres a loud crash; then Casey swishes the camera to 
reveal that a police car, its siren still moaning, has landed 
on top of a newstand, apparently dropped from the sky.




                                      82.

             CASEY
	(CONTD)
     How- how is that possible, thats 
     not possible-

Theres an explosion from nearby and shattered glass rains 
down onto the car.  Matt slams on the brakes, looking up 
through the windshield, searching the sky.

             MATT
     Where are you, man?

Theres a beat, and then a police officer abruptly appears on  
the passengers side, next to Casey.

             POLICE OFFICER
     Listen, you cant be here, I need 
     you to turn this car around right 
     now and-

The police officer is yanked upwards, disappearing from sight 
for a moment before coming crashing down thirty feet away.  
Casey screams.

             CASEY
     Whats...What is...Whats...Matt
     please, please-

The car SUDDENLY ROCKETS INTO THE AIR, straight up, flipping 
end over end, past the tops of the buildings, and then comes 
to a stop, hanging at about two hundred feet.  Caseys 
breathing is painfully short and sharp.  Matt stares out into 
the night sky.

He flicks on the brights.  Theres Andrew, in his hospital 
gown, floating a dozen feet out, his flesh charred and 
twisted, his body clearly wracked with agonizing pain.

A news helicopter circles past out of sight, and for a 
moment, Andrew is framed in the choppers spotlight.

His eyes flash to the car.

             ANDREW
        (screaming)
     WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!?

The windshield is TORN OUT, and seconds later MATT IS RIPPED 
OUT OF THE CAR AS THOUGH YANKED BY A GIANT HOOK, taking his 
seatbelt with him.

             CASEY
     No NO NO


                                      83.

The car goes into freefall, no longer important to Andrew, 
plummeting down, down, down.  Caseys screams are barely 
audible over the rushing of the wind as the buildings rush 
past outside, her camera frozen in place as she plummets to 
her death.

And then suddenly, so suddenly its completely disorienting, 
the side of the car bursts apart and were flying, blurred 
views of buildings, the sky, the side of some jeans...

Stillness.  Caseys camera is pointed down, showing her 
adidas...and Matts high-tops.

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     Stay here, okay?  You have to stay 
     here.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
        (barely coherent)
     You can fly?

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     Stay here.  I have to talk to 
     Andrew.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     Matt..what...

             MATT
	(O.S.)
     Casey, Im sorry, Im so sorry.

Matts feet suddenly go out of frame.

             CASEY
	(O.S.)
     Matt wait!  WAIT PLEASE!  MATT!

NOTE: In the following sequence, everything is seen in 
glimpses and glances, never lingering too long on one thing.  
Much of what happens should be seen through implication, 
rather than direct effect.

Everything happens very fast, and none of the cameras can 
fully keep track.

FROM SEVERAL HELICAMS.

The feed is crisp and clear, but without the satellite audio, 
meaning no narration from the reporter.  There are several 
choppers flying at different distances from the action, and 
we intercut as necessary.


                                      84.

EXT. DOWNTOWN PORTLAND

The news chopper at first shows Caseys destroyed car laying 
in the street, then pans back up to show Andrew, whos 
floating hunched over, vomiting.

Matt flies up behind him, and tries to help him, but Andrew 
shoves him away.  Were too far away to hear anything thats 
said.

Matt tries again, and Andrew yells something.  Matt, clearly 
upset, replies.  Andrew, talking fast and jerky, gestures 
towards his burns.  Matt tries to reply several times, but 
Andrew isnt hearing it.  Matt smiles nervously at the 
destruction, and says something gently.

Andrew replies, and whatever is said here, it causes a 
radical shift in Matts demeanor.  Hes no longer concerned; 
he seems repulsed.  Andrew says more, clearly SCREAMING at 
Matt.

Matt seems to beg Andrew for something and Andrew relents.  
Matt continues, more forcefully, and then notices something 
to his right.  A BUS SMASHES HIM OUT OF THE AIR, SWATTING HIM 
LIKE A BUG INTO THE SIDE OF AN APARTMENT COMPLEX.

Andrew suddenly turns, flailing an arm at us in the chopper; 
a mailbox comes CRASHING UP INTO THE CAMERA.

FROM MICHAEL ERNESTOS CAMERA.

MICHAEL ERNESTO is, along with several other people from his 
building, out on his roof.  He watches in horror as the 
helicopter Andrew hit goes out of control, falling out of 
frame.

Moments later, we hear the explosion as it crashes.

             MICHAEL ERNESTO
	(O.S.)
     Oh, oh no, those people, man, those 
     people, oh god-

             ERNESTOS NEIGHBOR
	(O.S.)
     Wheres the other guy?

             MICHAEL ERNESTO
	(O.S.)
     Hes fucking dead man, you saw- oh 
     shit oh shit-

Andrew comes toppling down out of the sky like a wounded 
bird, crashing into the roof.  He vomits again, mostly bile; 
everyone around him is in shock, frozen, as he screams in 
pain and rolls over.


                                      85.

Hes bleeding badly from the nose and ears.

             ANDREW
        (agonized, crying)
     No ones gonna help me...No ones 
     gonna help me now...

We get some shots from other peoples cameras, video phones, 
etc on the roof.  Some people scream and try to run past 
Andrew, and he blasts them off the roof like bowling pins, 
which leads to more screaming.

Andrew stands shakily, looking directly at Michael Ernesto.

             MICHAEL ERNESTO
	(O.S.)
     Please man, please, I dont know 
     you man-

             ANDREW
        (mumbled)
     What type of camera is that?

             MICHAEL ERNESTO
	(O.S.)
        (breaking down)
     What?  I dont know, I dont know 
     you man, I didnt- please okay, 
     please-

Andrew starts to raise an arm, when hes suddenly NAILED BY 
MATT, blasting by at well over eighty miles an hour.

FROM BANK SECURITY CAMERA.

The inside of the bank is quiet and peaceful, when MATT AND 
ANDREW COME CRASHING THROUGH THE ROOF.

FROM POLICE CAR DASHBOARD CAM.

The police car rockets up the street, but has to screech to a 
halt when MATT AND ANDREW COME EXPLODING OUT OF THE FRONT OF 
THE BANK.

The two of them brawl in the street for a moment; its not 
impressive martial arts, or even super powered, just two guys 
fighting for their lives.  Matt gets the upperhand, decking 
Andrew and driving him to the ground, and suddenly the cop 
car (our POV), lifts off.

WE GO FLYING INTO MATT, crashing out the camera as he turns 
and creates a telekinetic wall.


                                      86.

FROM CALA PRENTIS CAMERA.

CALA, filming from her apartment window, watches in shock and 
horror as the police car, carried by its momentum, is sent 
FLIPPING INTO THE AIR, and we glimpse it as it passes her 
window, lights still flaring.

Her sister rushes up, looking out the window.

             CALA
	(O.S.)
     Sissy stay away from the window!

             SISSY
     Whats happening whats happening-

             CALA
	(O.S.)
     Theyre right out there fighting!  
     Theyre-

Andrew and Matt come BLASTING UP THROUGH THE FLOOR IN THE 
KITCHEN OFF TO THE RIGHT, AND THEN OUT THROUGH THE CEILING.

FROM KPR-PORTLANDS HELICAM.

The two boys come smashing up through the roof of the 
apartment building.  Andrew flies low, and Matt gives chase.  
Andrew turns, beginning to telekinetically lob everything at 
street level at Matt; traffic lights, parking meters, trees, 
etc...

...But Matts too good a flyer.  What he doesnt block he 
simply dips and weaves around.  Andrew, clearly still woozy, 
is distracted and smashes into a street-light, wiping out on 
the asphalt.

             CAMERA-MAN
     Theyre down.  One of them just 
     went down.  Jesus christ.

Matt slowly lands nearby.  The camera zooms in and hits them 
both with a spotlight, causing Matt to shield his eyes and 
look up, scared, as Andrew struggles to stand.

We get a good look at the toll this is taking on him; Matts 
face is a crimson mask of blood from his nose, eyes, mouth 
and ears.  Hes limping badly, his clothes torn, visibly 
covered with injuries.  He looks like hes been in a car 
wreck.

             CAMERA-MAN
	(CONTD)
     Oh shit, look at him.


                                      87.

He approaches Andrew, talking again, more fervently.  Andrew 
just shakes his head, falling repeatedly as he tries to 
stand, like a wounded dog.

Two cop cars skid to a halt nearby, the officers unloading 
and taking cover.  One of them advances on Matt and Andrew, 
gun raised.  Matt goes out in front of Andrew, protective, 
pleading, raising his hands.

The cop is clearly panicked.  He fires a shot.   Matts arm 
whips out, impossible fast; he buckles and screams in pain, 
holding his hand, which is gushing blood.

Matt falls, screaming, and Andrew stands.  Andrew blasts the 
officers backwards.

             CAMERA-MAN
	(CONTD)
     OH SHIT!  Oh jesus christ!

Andrew approaches Matt, screaming and looking absolutely 
terrifying.  Matt turns and ROCKETS OFF INTO THE SKY, Andrew 
following a second later, tackling Matt out of the air.

FROM KPR-PORTLANDS LIVE-ON-THE-SCENE.

Were at street level in downtown, people are absolutely 
everywhere, wandering out into the street, baffled, scared 
and looking for answers.  A FIELD REPORTER fixes herself, 
preparing to speak.

             FIELD REPORTER
     Are we...Okay, yeah, gimme- two, 
     one- Were live on the scene on 
     Parson Boulevard just south of the 
     center of downtown, and-

Theres a rushing, screeching sound from around the corner.  
The camera jerks, and moves towards the corner, the cameraman 
man running to see what the sound is.

             FIELD REPORTER
	(CONTD)
     Shawn, wait, youre unplugged.  
     Shawn-

Something around the corner explodes, and Matt comes flying 
past overhead, slightly on fire, before Andrew comes lunging 
at Matt, catching him, twisting out and over the camera man, 
SLAMMING HIM INTO THE SIDE OF A SKYSCRAPER ON THE STREET.

Andrew lifts Matt up high into the air, scraping him against 
buildings on either side of the street, bouncing like a 
pinball until-


                                      88.

FROM ABC 5S HELICAM.

-Matt struggles, and theres a visible ripple in the air; a 
massive concussive burst, sending both of them rocketing 
downwards as though shot out of a cannon.

They strike the massive bronze statue of Portlandia, a 
trident wielding demigoddess, in front of the Michael Graves 
building, uprooting it from its pedestal before crashing to 
the ground.

Matts body accordions brutally when he lands, and he flops 
down at a broken, dead angle.  Andrew lands nearly as badly, 
lays still for a moment, and then begins twitching and 
screaming when the choppers spotlight hits him.

FROM MICHAEL GRAVES BUILDING EXTERIOR SECURITY CAMERA

The statue of Portlandia lays awkwardly in the street.  
Andrew writhes.  Matt is motionless, blood pooling around 
him, his back broken.

FROM POLICE DASHBOARD CAMS, HELICOPTER CAMERAS, HANDHELDS 
FROM WINDOWS, EVERYTHING.

A bunch of squad cars and emergency units converge around the 
front of the Michael Graves building and downed statue.  Matt 
and Andrews bodies are painted by spotlights as police and 
news helicopters hang overhead.

Police unload en-mass, guns out, immediately forming a 
perimeter and pushing in.  Were with them as they approach; 
the mood is of barely controlled panic, officers shouting 
back and forth to each other.

Andrew and Matt are polka-dotted by red-laser sight dots.

Andrew suddenly stands up, and several officers fire; the 
bullets spark off an invisible barrier in front of him, and 
he shakily raises both hands.

The all of the police officers, firemen and paramedics are 
telekinetically lifted into the air.

They hang struggling for a moment, and then all of their 
limbs go rigid.  Weve seen this before.

Andrew screams, and then...It all happens in under two 
seconds:


                                      89.

Matt swings an arm, blinding fast; the triton wielding arm of 
Portlandia bends jaggedly, bringing down the pitchfork hard, 
first through Andrew, then into the pavement.

Andrew stands impaled, a look of shock on his face, and then 
Matt flails up his hand; the bullet lodged inside fires out, 
striking Andrew in the head, killing him instantly.

All of the floating people drop, dazed.

Matt collapses.  After a moment, the police advance.

                             CUT TO BLACK.

FROM CLEAN ROOM CAMS.

The clean room cams are incredibly hi-def, crisp and clear, 
with all manner of data and time codes scrolling all over the 
top and bottom of the screens.

Matt lays on the floor of a perfectly white room.  At the far 
end is a blackened out two way mirror.  Theres a camera on 
the inside of this too, and we can see resolute men in suits 
reflected on the inner glass, watching with unreadable 
expressions.

There is a chair and a table, but hes clearly fallen out of 
the chair.  Its maybe an hour after the scene in front of 
the Michael Graves building, and hes received no medical 
attention.

To this end, Matt is suffering from, among other things, 
massive blood-loss, multiple broken bones, dozens of gashes 
and cuts, presumed internal bleeding, and a broken back.

He can barely move, sliding around on the floor in his own 
blood as he dies, watched by the compassionless eyes of the 
cameras.

He is barely coherent, screeching in agony.

             MATT
     Please...Help me. Help me, HELP ME, 
     please...Im sorry!  Im so sorry, 
     I tried- help me, help me, Im 
     dying, Im dying.  Stars- I see 
     stars, somebody- It hurts, please.  
     Im- the blood...I tried...

Two men in contamination suits enter the room, wielding some 
kind of radiation sensors.  They go over to Matt, scanning 
him.


                                      90.

             MATT
	(CONTD)
     Listen, help me, help me.  Im 
     dying, you have to help me, dont 
     just let me- PLEASE IM SORRY!  Im 
     SORRY!  HELP ME! I-

The men ignore him as Matt makes some gasping sounds, his 
eyes going wide.

             MATT
	(CONTD)
     I can...I can hear the singing.

Matt entirely stops moving.  He lays there, not breathing, 
completely still.

And then suddenly the two men are flung backwards, as is the 
table and the chair.  There are a series of grotesque popping 
and snapping sounds from Matts body, and he jerks,  and 
writhes, pushing himself up onto his hands and knees.

The security cams track and zoom, and as Matt stands, we 
realize a startling truth: his cuts are closing themselves.  
His broken bones have already molded back into place.  His 
bruises are shrinking away to nothing.

The blacked out glass suddenly shatters, and falls out of its 
frame, revealing a shocked, frightened room of high ranking 
military personnel, along with several men in civilian 
clothes.

Matt stares at them.  They stare back at him.

             4-STAR GENERAL
        (terrified)
     Listen...Son, you dont- I mean...

Matt raises a finger to his lips, and the general trails off.  
Matt smile weakly for a moment, then stops.

             MATT
     Would you please...turn off the 
     fucking cameras.

                             CUT TO BLACK.

HOLD ON BLACK 
FOR A MOMENT.

SMALL TITLE: (2 
YEARS LATER)


                                      91.

FROM INTERNATIONAL NEWS BROADCASTS.

We see a variety of international reporters covering a 
breaking story, but only see little clips of each, in 
multiple languages.  Behind them are various shots of a huge 
hydroelectric dam in South Korea.

             REPORTERS
     -expected to burst at any moment- 
     City officials blame the 
     malfunctions on the terrorist 
     bombing that occurred at the dams 
     control center last March.-  
     Botched evacuation has left 
     thousands of the Kyo-lee Valleys 
     residents trapped, with only one 
     major roadway leading in or out.  A 
     roadway that has not been repaired 
     in over ten years- Again, the scale 
     here is just unprecedented.  Our 
     hearts are with people of Kyo-Lee
     tonight.

FROM KIM HAI-SUS CAMERA.

INT. KIM HAI-SUS HOUSE

Kim Hai-Su, 17, is behind the camera filming his father, 40s, 
as his father hurries to gather his things into a duffle.  
Kim Hai-Sus younger brother, 8, wanders into the room, 
crying loudly, and Kims father screams at him to put down 
the camera.



Theyre in the car, driving fast through town.  All around we 
can see people panicking, and we see two cars collide on the 
road up ahead.



They pull up onto an on-ramp, and are immediately trapped 
into gridlocked, dead-end traffic.  Kim Hai-Sus father 
begins shrieking, and banging on the dashboard, which 
triggers his younger brother crying again.  Kim shouts to 
calm down.



Kim is climbing out of the car; people all around are getting 
out of their cars, hopelessly trapped.  Someone screams, and 
Kim turns to reveal an enormous dam several miles away.  


                                      92.

Rubble is falling off the side of an gigantic crack, which 
splits further.  Kim yells in fear.  The crack widens, an 
enormous tidal gush of water bursts through, gushing down the 
side of the hills into the valley.

Kims father embraces him, and they have a brief exchange, 
when suddenly theres the sound of a sonic boom overhead.

All around them people EXPLODE into cheers.  Its not fear, 
but rather a kind of frantic ovation.  The camera sweeps up, 
panning the empty blue sky excitedly, finally coming to rest 
on

Matt Garrety.

Looking fucking great as he floats above the freeway.  He 
pantomimes yeah, bring it on, cheer louder!  This gets the 
intended response, and he pumps a fist shouting FUCK YEAH 
KOREA!

He turns, pretending to notice the oncoming flood for the 
first time, mouths Oh shit!  Points at the flood casually 
as it closes in: I should deal with this.  Another huge 
ovation, and Matt smiles widely nods his head yeahhhhhh! 
and turns.

Theres a sonic boom as he goes from zero to mach 4 in less 
than a second, rattling the cars on the freeway, disappearing 
into the distance over the flood.

After a moment, the impossibly huge onrush of water seems to 
stop, slowing and freezing in place, and then...SLOWLY BEGINS 
TO REWIND TOWARDS THE DAM.

The camera jerks around wildly as the crowd goes insane,
embracing, kissing, screaming, jumping on their cars.  Kims 
father has collapsed into tears of joy next to the car, and 
Kim himself is hooting and hollering from the bottom of his 
lungs.

The camera comes up to show his little brother, who is going 
positively ape-shit on the hood of their car, jumping up and 
down, screaming, smiling...

An unearthly, angelic, vibrating chorus of voices starts to 
rise, rise, singing and we-
