AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY   

AN ENDLESS SKY AT TWILIGHT

Foreboding. Heat lightning in the distance. Miles of 
unforgiving, summer-scorched prairie. 

             BEVERLY
	(OS)
      ...Life is very long...

MILES OF STRAIGHT ROAD 

Two lanes, not a car in sight. Cracked asphalt undulates over 
gentle, browned hills, disappears into an infinite horizon.

             BEVERLY
	(OS)
      TS Eliot.  Not the first person to say 
      it, certainly not the first person to 
      think it.

A LAKE IN THE GATHERING DUSK

Flat, still.  An empty aluminum rowboat lolls listlessly, 
tied haphazardly to an old wooden dock.

             BEVERLY
	(OS)
      But hes given credit for it because 
      he bothered to write it down.

AN OLD FARM HOUSE SITTING ATOP A LOW HILL

At the end of a long gravel road.  Surrounded by towering 
black walnuts and lace-bark elms.  A farm once, no ones put 
a plow to earth here in decades.

             BEVERLY
	(OS)
      So if you say it, you have to say his 
      name after it. Life is very long: TS 
      Eliot. Absolutely goddamn right.

Wrap around porches, forgotten gardens.  Imposing in the 
gathering gloom.  A single downstairs window glows.

             BEVERLY
	(OS)
	(CONTD)
      Give the devil his due.  Very few 
      poets couldve made it through Eliots 
      trial and come out, brilliantined and 
      double-breasted and Anglican.



                                2.


And now, a face fills the screen --

INT. BEVERLYS DIMLY LIT STUDY - TWILIGHT


BEVERLY WESTON. A craggy, wise and deeply sad Okie.  We take 
a long moment, just to study that face.

             BEVERLY
      Not hard to imagine, faced with 
      Eliots first wife, lovely Viv, how 
      Crane or Berryman might have reacted, 
      just foot-raced to the nearest bridge; 
      Olympian Suicidalists.

Stares out the window at the darkening, ominous horizon. 

             BEVERLY
	(CONTD)
      Not Eliot: after sufficient years of 
      ecclesiastical guilt, plop her in the 
      nearest asylum and get on with it.

He sits at a cluttered desk, his face damp with sweat. Nurses 
a glass of whiskey, his staggered delivery due more to his 
careful selection of words than drunkenness.  Hes talking to 
someone we do not yet see.

             BEVERLY
	(CONTD)
      God-a-mighty.  You have to admire the 
      purity of the survivors instinct.

From somewhere upstairs, a THUD. He looks to the ceiling.

             BEVERLY
	(CONTD)
      Violet.  My wife.  She takes pills, 
      sometimes a great many. They affect... 
      among other things, her equilibrium.  
      Fortunately, they eliminate her need 
      for equilibrium... 


INT. VIOLETS BEDROOM - TWILIGHT


Full of shadows. She sits up slowly from rumpled sheets. 
Were on her profile, CLOSE, silhouetted against the faint 
light from the open bathroom door.  She hesitates on the edge 
of the bed, getting her bearings.  Finds a pack of Winstons, 
lights one.  Listens to the voices filtering up from below. 


                                3.

INT. THE STUDY - TWILIGHT

Beverly shifts, waiting for the sound of more movement from 
the rooms overhead.  When there is none --

             BEVERLY
      My wife takes pills and I drink. 
      Thats the bargain weve struck.

                             INTERCUT WITH:

INT. VIOLETS BEDROOM/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - TWILIGHT

She gathers herself to stand.  Moves to the door.  We FOLLOW 
HER CLOSELY.  Her hair unkempt, her steps unsteady, into --

             BEVERLY
      The reasons why we partake are  
      anymore inconsequential. 

The hallway, walls lined with photos of long-dead pioneer 
ancestors and faded school photographs of three daughters.

             BEVERLY
	(CONTD)
      The facts are: my wife takes pills and 
      I drink.  Thats the bargain weve 
      struck, just one paragraph of our 
      marriage contract... cruel covenant. 
      And these facts have over time made 
      burdensome the maintenance of 
      traditional American routine.

She makes her way to the stairs starts down.

             BEVERLY
	(CONTD)
      Rather than once more vow abstinence 
      with my fingers crossed in the queasy 
      hope of righting our ship, Ive chosen 
      to turn my life over to a Higher Power 
      and join the ranks of the Hiring 
      Class.

The light from the study slices across the living room. 

             BEVERLY
	(CONTD)
      Its not a decision with which Im 
      entirely comfortable. I know how to 
      launder my dirty undies. Done it all 
      my life, but Im finding its getting 
      in the way of my drinking.

She can see a portion of Beverlys desk, a womans legs.


                                4.


             BEVERLY
	(CONTD)
      Sorry about the heat in here. My wife 
      is cold-blooded and not just in the 
      metaphorical sense.  She does not 
      believe in air-conditioning... as if 
      it is a thing to be disbelieved. I 
      knew your father, you know.  Bought 
      many a watermelon from Mr Youngbloods 
      fruit stand.  He did pass, didnt he??

             JOHNNA
      Yes, sir.

             BEVERLY
      May I ask how? 

             JOHNNA
      He had a heart attack.  Fell into a 
      flatbed truck full of wine grapes.

             BEVERLY
      Wine grapes.  In Oklahoma.  Im sorry.

             VIOLET
      Bev...?!

             BEVERLY
      Yes?



             VIOLET
      Did you pullish? Did you...Oh, goddamn 
      it... did. You. Are the police here?


             BEVERLY
      No...

She stands in the shadows of the living room, confused.

             VIOLET
      Am I looking through window? A window?

             BEVERLY
      Can you come here?

She steps into the study, emerging from the darkness into 
light to reveal: VIOLET WESTON.  Dissipated, dishevelled, 
late sixties.  She wears pajamas and a much slept-in robe.

             VIOLET
      Oh.  Hello.

Shes staring at a woman sitting in front of Beverlys desk: 
JOHNNA.  Thirty, Native American, simply dressed.


                                5.


             BEVERLY
      Johnna, the young woman I told you 
      about.

             VIOLET
      You tell me shes a woman. Wo-man. 
      Whoa-man.

             BEVERLY
      That Im hiring --

             VIOLET
      Oh, you hire womens now the thing.  
      I thought you meant the other woman.

             BEVERLY
      To cook and clean, take you to the 
      clinic and to the --

             VIOLET
        (over-articulating)
      In the intrest of ...civil action,  
      your par-tic-u-lars way of speak- 
      king, I thought you meant you had 
      thought a whoa-man to be HIRED!

             BEVERLY
      I dont understand you.

             VIOLET
        (winsome, to Johnna)
      Hello.

             JOHNNA
      Hello.

             VIOLET
     Im sorry.
        (curtsies)
      Like this.

             JOHNNA
      Yes, maam.

             VIOLET
      Youre very pretty.

             JOHNNA
      Thank you.

             VIOLET
      Are you an Indian?



                                6.


             JOHNNA
      Yes, maam.

		VIOLET
	What kind?

		JOHNNA
	Cheyenne.

             VIOLET
      Do you think Im pretty?

             JOHNNA
      Yes, maam.

             VIOLET
        (curtsies again)
      Like...this?
        (curtsies again)
      Like this?

She stumbles, catches herself.

             BEVERLY
      Careful...

             VIOLET
      Youre the house now.  Im sorry,     
      I took some medicine for my mussss... 
      muscular.

             BEVERLY
      Why dont you go back to bed, 
      sweetheart?

             VIOLET
      Why dont you go fuck a fucking   
      sows ass?

             BEVERLY
      All right.

             VIOLET
      Im sorry. Ill be sickly sweet. Im 
      soooooooo sweet. In-el-abrially sweet.

She smiles at Johnna, goes.  Beverly watches her disappear 
back up the stairs, then -- 


                                7.


             BEVERLY
      We keep unusual hours here.  Try not 
      to differentiate between night and 
      day.  You wont be able to keep a 
      healthy routine.

             JOHNNA
      I need the work.

             BEVERLY
      I myself require very little 
      attention, thrive without it, sort   
      of a human cactus.  My wife has been 
      diagnosed with a touch of cancer, so 
      shell need to be driven to Tulsa for 
      her final chemotherapy treatments.  
      Youre welcome to use that American-
      made behemoth parked out in the drive.  
      Welcome to make use of anything, 
      everything, all this garbage weve 
      acquired, our lifes work.  Do you 
      have any questions?

             JOHNNA
      What kind of cancer?

             BEVERLY
      My God, I nearly neglected the punch 
      line: mouth cancer.

             JOHNNA
      What pills does she take?

             BEVERLY
      Valium.  Vicodin.  Darvon, Darvocet.  
      Percodan, Percocet.  Xanax for fun.  
      OxyContin in a pinch.  And of course 
      Diluadid. I cant forget Diluadid.

Beverly wobbles to his feet, explores his bookshelf.

             BEVERLY
	(CONTD)
      By night within that ancient house, 
      Immense, black, damned, anonymous.
        (and)
      My last refuge, my books: simple 
      pleasures, like finding wild onions by 
      the side of a road, or requited love.

He takes a book from the bookshelf, gives it to her. 


                                8.


             BEVERLY
	(CONTD)
      TS Eliot.  Read it or not.  It isnt  
      a job requirement, just for your 
      enjoyment.
        (beat)
      Here we go, round the prickly pear...
      Prickly pear prickly pear...
      Here we go round the prickly pear...

OPENING TITLES


Were underwater.  Light fractures and scatters above. The 
surface undulating gently as we GLIDE through a lakes   
dark, tenebrous waters on a moonlit night.

A rowboat SLIPS across our field of vision. Its aluminum 
hull cutting through the calm above, sending out small waves 
as it makes its way SLOWLY past.

Oars dip in on either side, propelling the small craft toward 
deeper water. It slows. Stops. Bobs gently. We wait, watch -- 

And then suddenly, something large hits the surface above, 
indistinct, exploding the calm, coming towards us, sinking 
fast as TITLES END --


A SHAPE

Prone, silhouetted against a sunlit window across the room.  
A body, her back to us. The phone RINGS.  Once, twice. The 
body doesnt move. A girls voice calls from downstairs. 

             JEAN
	(OS)
     Mom...?

The phone continues to RING. Still no movement.

             JEAN
	(OS)
	(CONTD)
     Mom...!

Nothing. The ringing stops. A moment of silence, followed by 
irritated teenage footsteps on the carpeted stairs. 

             JEAN
	(OS)
	(CONTD)
     ...Mom...?

The hallway door opens, were in --


                                9.
INT. BARBARAS BEDROOM - DAY


JEAN, fourteen, precocious, sticks her head in.

             JEAN
      ...Mom?

A sound from the body, still no movement.

             BARBARA
      Mmm...

             JEAN
      You didnt hear the phone?

             BARBARA
      If its your father, tell him to   
      fuck off.

             JEAN
      Its Aunt Ivy in Oklahoma.

New deal. She sits up. CLOSE ON: BARBARA FORDHAM, late-
forties, fully dressed.  She gropes for the phone.

             BARBARA
      ...Ivy? ...whats wrong?

Barb stands, moves slowly to the window. Outside: identical 
suburban homes, neutral house colors, lawns.

We STUDY Barb as she listens. Greying roots, no make-up, a 
few extra pounds.  A woman who, for reasons we dont yet 
understand, has decided to stop giving a damn.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      ...When...?

Jean passes in the hall. Stops, watching as her mother slowly 
dissolves, reaches for the sill, lowers herself to sit.


INT/EXT. WESTON HOUSE (PAWHUSKA, OKLAHOMA) - DAY


A battered Honda Civic makes its way up the long drive from 
the highway below, dust swirling behind it. Its hot. Bright.

The Honda parks. IVY WESTON, forties, shy and soft-spoken, 
attractive enough but expert at hiding it, climbs out.  
Stares up at the trees surrounding the old farm house.  The 
precarious old barn out back and untended flower beds.   


                                10.

INT. WESTON KITCHEN - DAY


Johnna washes a dish at the sink.  Watches Ivys arrival 
through the kitchen window.  Makes no motion to go to her --


INT. THE WESTON HOUSE - DAY


Ivy steps into the dark house.  Drapes drawn, lights off.

             IVY
      Mom...?
        (no answer)
     Mom?

Steps into the open door of her fathers study.  His vacant 
desk chair, untouched papers, dust mots settling in the 
sunlight.  She takes a moment, then heads upstairs.  CARRYING 
US with her.  Finds Violet, in her bedroom, sitting in front 
of her vanity in near darkness, smoking and on the phone.  

             VIOLET
      ...Youve been out there...?

Barely acknowledges Ivys arrival.  The room is unruly.  Bed 
unmade.  Clothes draped over chairs. Dresser and night-stands 
cluttered with pills, tissue boxes, creams and lotions. 

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      ...Youre going out yourself...?


Ivy wanders into the bath.  More pills, wet towels on the 
floor.  She turns off the dripping faucet.  Picks up towels.  

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      Stop that...

Violet is off the phone, standing in hall, watching Ivy.  Ivy 
stops, briefly chastened.  Violet opens a bottle of pills. 

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      You call Barb?  Whatd she say?

             IVY
      Shes on her way.

             VIOLET
      Whatd you tell her?

             IVY
      I told her Dad was missing.


                                11.


             VIOLET
      Did you tell her how long hed been 
      missing?

             IVY
      Five days.

             VIOLET
      What did she say?

             IVY
      She said she was on her way.

             VIOLET
      Goddamn it, Ivy, what did she say?

             IVY
      She said she was on her way.

             VIOLET
      Youre hopeless.
        (heads back into her room)
      Goddamn your father for putting me 
      through this. Seen that office of his, 
      all that mess? I cant make heads or 
      tails of it. He hired this Indian for 
      some goddamn reason and now I have a 
      stranger in my house. Whats her name?

Ivy follows her mother, returns to tidying up.

             IVY
      Johnna.  Who was on the phone?

             VIOLET
      This house is falling apart, something 
      about the basement or the sump pump or 
      the foundation.  I dont know anything 
      about it.  I cant do this by myself.

             IVY
      I called Karen.

             VIOLET
      What did she say?

             IVY
      She said shed try to get here.

             VIOLET
      Shell be a big fat help, just     
      like you.


                                12.


             VIOLET
	(CONT'D)
        (takes another pill)
      I need Barb.

             IVY
      Whats Barb going to be able to do?

Ivy moves on to hanging clothes back in the jammed closet.

             VIOLET
      What did you do to your hair?

             IVY
      I had it straightened.

             VIOLET
      You had it straightened.  Why would 
      anybody do that?

             IVY
      I just wanted a change.

             VIOLET
      Youre the prettiest of my three 
      girls, but you always look like a 
      schlub. Why dont you wear makeup?

             IVY
      Do I need makeup?

             VIOLET
      All women need makeup.  Dont let 
      anybody tell you different.  The only 
      woman who was pretty enough to go 
      without makeup was Elizabeth Taylor 
      and she wore a ton. Stand up straight.

             IVY
      Mom. 

             VIOLET
      Your shoulders are slumped and your 
      hairs all straight and you dont wear 
      makeup.  You look like a lesbian.

Violet takes another pill.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      You could get a decent man if you 
      spruced up.  A bit, thats all Im 
      saying. 

             IVY
      Im not looking for a man.


                                13.


             VIOLET
      There are a lot of losers out there, 
      dont think I dont know that.  But 
      just because you got a bad one last 
      time doesnt mean --

             IVY
      Barry wasnt a loser.

             VIOLET
      Barry was an asshole.  I warned you 
      from the jump, first time you brought 
      him over here in his little electric 
      car with his stupid orange hair and 
      that turban --

             IVY
      It wasnt a turban --

             VIOLET
      You work at a college.  Dont tell me 
      there arent people coming through the 
      door of that library every day.

             IVY
      You want me to marry some eighteen 
      year old boy from one of these hick 
      towns?

             VIOLET
      They still have teachers at TU, right? 
      They did when your father taught 
      there.

Violet takes another pill.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      How many was that?

             IVY
      I wasnt counting.

Violet takes another pill.

             IVY
	(CONTD)
      Is your mouth burning?

             VIOLET
      Like a son-of-a-bitch.  My tongue    
      is on fire.

             IVY
      Are you supposed to be smoking?


                                14.


             VIOLET
      Is anybody supposed to smoke?

             IVY
      You have cancer of the mouth.

             VIOLET
      Just leave it alone.

             IVY
        (after a moment)
      Are you scared?

             VIOLET
      Course Im scared.  And you are a 
      comfort, sweetheart.  Thank God one of 
      my girls stayed close to home.

Outside, the sound of a CAR pulling up. Ivy pulls back the 
drape and the shade, finds a big Cadillac arriving.

             IVY
      Aunt Mattie Faes here.

             VIOLET
      She means to come in here and tell   
      me whats what.

             IVY
      I dont know how Uncle Charlie puts  
      up with it.

             VIOLET
      He smokes a lot of grass.

             IVY
      He does?

             VIOLET
      He smokes a lot of grass.

INT/EXT. CHARLIES CADILLAC/WESTON HOUSE - DAY

             MATTIE FAE
      I told Vi, Take all those goddamn 
      books hes so fond of and make a big 
      pile in the front yard and have 
      yourself a bonfire.

MATTIE FAE AIKEN, sixty-one, Violets baby sister, larger 
than life, is in the passenger seat.  CHARLIE, Mattie Faes 
husband, easy-going, is behind the wheel.


                                15.


             CHARLIE
      You dont burn a mans books.

             MATTIE FAE
      You do, if the situation calls for it.

             CHARLIE
      The mans books didnt do anything.

             MATTIE FAE
      You get any ideas about just up and 
      taking off, Charlie Aiken, you better 
      believe --

             CHARLIE
      Im not going anywhere.

Charlie parks, they climb out into the blinding sunlight.

             MATTIE FAE
      Im saying if you did, Ill give you 
      two days to get your head straight and 
      then its all going up in a blaze of 
      glory.  Not that you have any books 
      lying around.  I dont think Ive ever 
      seen you read a book in my life.

             CHARLIE
      That bother you?

             MATTIE FAE
      Whats the last book you read?

             CHARLIE
      Beverly was a teacher; teachers read 
      books, Im in the upholstery business.

Ivy comes out of the house to meet them.  Mattie Fae spots 
her, makes a beeline for her, envelopes Ivy in a hug.

             MATTIE FAE
      Ah, sweetie.  Your daddys done this 
      before.  Just takes off, no call, 
      nothing.  I told your mother, You 
      pack that son-of-a-bitchs bags and 
      have em waiting for him on the front 
      porch.

Mattie Fae sweeps past Ivy into the --


                                16.
INT. WESTON HOUSE - DAY

Ivy and Charlie follow.

             MATTIE FAE
      Wheres your mother? 

             IVY
     Upstairs.

             CHARLIE
      Theyve always had trouble, Ivy.

             MATTIE FAE
      Hell come back again, I know he will, 
      he always does. Beverly is a very 
      complicated man.

             IVY
      Kind of like Charles.

             CHARLIE
      Yes, like Little Charles. Exactly --

             MATTIE FAE 
      Oh.  Hes nothing like Little Charles.

             CHARLIE
      She just means in their sort of quiet 
      complicated ways -- 

             MATTIE FAE
      Little Charles isnt complicated,  
      hes just unemployed.

The phone begins to RING.  Ivy eyes it apprehensively.

             CHARLIE
      Hes an observer.

             MATTIE FAE
      All he observes is the television. 
        (and)
      Why is it so dark in here?

             CHARLIE
      So you cant even see Ivys point? 
      That Little Charles and Beverly   
      share some kind of... complication.

             MATTIE FAE
      You have to be smart to be 
      complicated.


                                17.


The phone STOPS.  Violets answered it upstairs.

             CHARLIE
      Are you saying our boy isnt smart?

             MATTIE FAE
      Yes, thats what Im saying.

Ivy steals glances upstairs, concerned about the phone.

             MATTIE FAE
	(CONTD)
      Im sweating.  Are you sweating?

             CHARLIE
      Hell, yes, Im sweating, its ninety 
      degrees in here.

             MATTIE FAE
      Feel my back.

             CHARLIE
      I dont want to feel your back.

             MATTIE FAE
      Sweat is just dripping down my back.

             CHARLIE
      I believe you.

             MATTIE FAE
      Feel it. 

             CHARLIE
      No.

             MATTIE FAE
      Come on, put your hand here --

             CHARLIE
      Goddamn it --

             MATTIE FAE
      Sweats just dripping...

Mattie Fae pulls back a set of drapes, finds the light is 
blocked by shades sealed with tape.

             MATTIE FAE
	(CONTD)
      Ivy, when did this start?  This 
      business with taping the shades?

             IVY
      Been a couple of years now.


                                18.


Mattie Fae starts peeling off the tape. 

             MATTIE FAE
      Is it that long since weve been here?

             CHARLIE
      Do you know its purpose?  You cant 
      tell if its night or day.

             IVY
      I think thats the purpose.

Ivy goes, Charlie notices Mattie Fae pulling off tape.

             CHARLIE
      Dont do that.  This isnt your place.

             MATTIE FAE
      The body needs sunlight.

INT/EXT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - AFTERNOON

Jean has on headphones, listening to her Walkman in the back.
Barbaras estranged husband, BILL FORDHAM, drives the rental.
Barbs in the passenger seat beside him, watching the brown 

countryside pass by.

             BARBARA
      What were these people thinking... the 
      jokers who settled this place.   Who 
      was the asshole who saw this flat hot 
      nothing and planted his flag?  I mean 
      we fucked the Indians for this?

             BILL
      Well, genocide always seems like such 
      a good idea at the time. 

             BARBARA
      Right, you need a little hindsight.

             BILL
      If you want me to explain the creepy 
      character of the Midwest, youre --

             BARBARA
      Please, the Midwest.  This is the 
      Plains: a state of mind, right?  A 
      spiritual affliction, like the Blues.


                                19.



             BILL
      You okay?  Im fine.  Just got the 
      Plains.

They laugh.  He reaches across, touches her tenderly. 

             BARBARA
      Dont.

He withdraws quickly.  


INT. VIOLETS BEDROOM - DAY

Violet hangs up the phone.  Sits for a long moment, absorbing 
what shes heard.  Mattie Fae watches from her spot sitting 
on the corner of the bed, concerned.  Ivy is in the door.

             VIOLET
      They checked the hospitals, no 
      Beverly. 

             MATTIE FAE
      Whos this now?  The highway patrol?

             VIOLET
      No, the sheriff, the Gilbeau boy. 

             IVY
      What else did he say?

             VIOLET
      The boats missing.

             IVY
      Dads boat?


             VIOLET
      I asked the sheriff to send a deputy 
      out to the dock to check if anybody 
      had seen him and his boat is gone.

Ivy watches her mother being comforted by Mattie Fae.  Wants 
to go to her.  Doesnt.

MOVED TO A17

                                20.
INT/EXT. RENTAL CAR/WESTON HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Bill slows the rental car to turn.  Barb looks down the road 
and across the field to where the farm house peeks out 
through the trees, beckoning, threatening, ominous.

Bill pulls the rental in front of the house.  Turns off the 
ignition.  Neither moves to get out. Jean realizes theyve 
stopped, pulls off her headphones.

             JEAN
      Im gonna grab a smoke.

Jean heads for the relative privacy of the fence at the edge 
of the yard.  Leaving Bill and Barb alone, watching. 

             BARBARA
      Youve encouraged that.

             BILL
      I havent encouraged anything.

             BARBARA
      You admire her for getting hooked    
      at fourteen, makes her seem even   
      more mature.

Barbara climbs out.  Bill follows.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      Goddamn, its hot.

Bill unlocks the trunk, begins unloading luggage.

             BILL
      Suppose your moms turned on the air 
      conditioner?

             BARBARA
      You kidding?  Remember the parakeets?

             BILL
      The parakeets?

             BARBARA
      I didnt tell you about the parakeets?  
      She got a parakeet for some insane 
      reason, and the little fucker croaked 
      after two days.  So she went to the 
      pet store and raised hell and they 
      gave her another parakeet. That one 
      died after one day.  

                                21.


             BARBARA
	(CONT'D)
      So she went back and they gave her a 
      third parakeet and that one died too.  
      So the chick from the pet store came 
      out here to see just what in the hell 
      this serial parakeet killer was doing 
      to bump off these birds.

They head for the house with suitcases, wilting in the heat.

             BILL
      And?

             BARBARA
      The heat. It was too hot. They were 
      dying from the heat.

             BILL
      Jesus.

             BARBARA
      These are tropical birds, all right?  
      They live in the fucking tropics.

He laughs.  Barb looks over to Jean smoking by the fence.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      What, is she smoking a cigar?

             BILL
      Are you ready for this?

             BARBARA
      No.  No way.

INT. WESTON HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Charlie is poking around the old stereo, finds an LP, the TV 
beside him is tuned to a Royals game. 

             CHARLIE
      Violets a Clapton fan?

Johnna passes through, Charlie holds up his empty bottle.

             CHARLIE
	(CONTD)
      Scuse me, dear...could I trouble you 
      for another beer? 

             MATTIE FAE 
      Goddam it, shes not a waitress.


                                22.


             CHARLIE
      I know that.

             MATTIE FAE 
      Then get your own beer. 

             JOHNNA
        (takes the empty/goes)
      Ill get it. 

             MATTIE FAE
      I dont believe you.  Watchin a ball 
      game, drinkin beers.  You have any 
      sense of whats going on around you?

             CHARLIE
      Am I supposed to sit here like a 
      statue?  Youre drinking whiskey.

             MATTIE FAE 
      Im having a cocktail.

             CHARLIE
      Youre drinking straight whiskey!

             MATTIE FAE
      Just... show a little class.

             BARBARA
      ...Mom?

Barbara and Bill have entered, are quickly descended upon by 
Mattie Fae and Charlie.  Hugs, overlapping dialogue.

		  MATTIE FAE
	(CONTD)
	Oh my God, Barbara --!  You 
	give me some sugar!

		  MATTIE FAE
	(CONTD)
	Bill!  Look how skinny you 
	are!

             BILL
      Hi, Charlie.

		BARBARA
	Hi, Aunt Mattie Fae --

		BILL
	Hi, Mattie Fae.

Jean enters behind her parents, stands sheepishly.

             MATTIE FAE
      Oh my gosh, will you look at this one?  
      Come here and give your Aunt Mattie 
      Fae some sugar!

                                23.


		  MATTIE FAE
	(CONTD)
	My gosh, youre so big!  Look 
	at your boobs!  Last time I 
	saw you, you looked like a 
	little boy!

		CHARLIE
	Lo, Bill.  Man you have 
	dropped some weight, havent 
	you?  Hello, sweetheart.

             BARBARA
      Hi, Uncle Charlie.

             CHARLIE
      How was the flight from Denver? 

             BILL
      Fine...

Violet appears on the stairs, rushes to Barbara.

             VIOLET
      Barb...

             BARBARA
      Its okay, Mom.  Im here, Im here.  
      Shh, its okay, Im here.

Ivy appears at the top of the stairs, watches her mother in 
her sisters arms.  Bill turns to Charlie, quietly: 

             BILL
	No word then?

      		CHARLIE
	No.

	       VIOLET
	What am I going to do?

		MATTIE FAE
	No, huh-uh.

		BARBARA
	Its okay, Mom.

             BARBARA
      Did you see Bill and Jean?

Violet takes them in, disoriented.

             VIOLET
      Yes.  Hi, Bill.

             BILL
      Hello, Violet.

             VIOLET
      Im just so scared.

             MATTIE FAE
      Of course you are, poor thing.


                                24.


             VIOLET
        (sees Jean)
      Well, look at you.

             MATTIE FAE
      Isnt she the limit?  Look at her 
      boobs!

             JEAN
      O-kay, weve all stared at my      
      tits now.

             MATTIE FAE
      Theyre just so darn big.

Vi hugs Jean. Johnna slips in, leaves a beer for Charlie.

             VIOLET
      Youre just the prettiest thing.  
      Thank you for coming to see me.

             BARBARA
      Ivy, I didnt see you up there.

Ivy, still standing above on the stairs.

             IVY
      It looked crowded.

             BARBARA
      God, you look good.  Doesnt she   
      look good, Bill?

	       BILL
	Yes, she does.

		BARBARA
	I love your hair, that looks 
        great.


             VIOLET
      She had it straightened.  Barbara,   
      or Bill, it doesnt matter, I need   
      you to go through Beverlys things, 
      help me with this paperwork.

             BARBARA
      Well... we can do that, Mom.

             IVY
      I was going to help with --

             VIOLET
      No, now that desk of his is such a 
      mess and I get confused --


                                25.


             BILL
      Ill take care of it, Violet --

             BARBARA
        (to Charlie)
      Which room are you in?

             MATTIE FAE
      Were gonna head home soon.

             VIOLET
      Youre going back to Tulsa?

             MATTIE FAE
      We have to, we left in such a rush we 
      didnt get anyone to take care of the 
      damn dogs. Anyway, I know you want to 
      spend some time with these girls.

             VIOLET
      How about Little Charles, cant he 
      take care of the dogs?

             CHARLIE
      Well, yeah, I guess he could --

	     MATTIE FAE 
	No, he cant.  We have to get 
	back.

		CHARLIE
	Maybe we should call him, 
	Mattie Fae --

             MATTIE FAE
      We talked about this.

             BARBARA
      Mom, can Jean stay in the attic?

             VIOLET
      No, thats where whats-her-name 
      lives.

             IVY
      Johnna.

             BARBARA
      Whos Johnna?

             VIOLET
      Shes the Indian who lives in my 
      attic.

             BARBARA
      Shes the what?


                                26.
EXT. THE YARD - LATE AFTERNOON

Jean steps out onto the porch.  Sees Johnna across the road 
by the fence.  Heads for her --

             JEAN
      Hi...

Johnna is cutting off sprigs of wild mint entangled in the 
fence, standing in what was once a vegetable garden.

             JOHNNA
      Hello. 

		JEAN
	Im Jean.

		JOHNNA
	Johnna.


Johnna keeps working, Jean watches.

             JEAN
      I like your necklace.

A beaded pouch in the shape of a turtle.

		JOHNNA
	Thank you.

             JEAN
      Did you make that?

             JOHNNA
      My grandma.

             JEAN
      Is there something in it?

             JOHNNA
      My umbilical cord.

Jean recoils.  Johnna smiles.

             JEAN
      Ewww, are you serious?

             JOHNNA
      When a Cheyenne is born, their 
      umbilical cord is dried and sewn   
      into a pouch.  


                                27.


             JEAN
      Youre Cheyenne.  Like that movie 
      Powwow Highway.  Did you see that?

             JOHNNA
      Yes.  We wear it for the rest of our 
      lives.  If we lose it, our souls 
      belong nowhere and when we die our 
      souls walk the Earth looking for where 
      we belong.

Johnna starts back for the house with her mint.  Off Jean --

INT. THE BACK PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON

A screened in back porch off the kitchen. Bill and Barb sit 
at an old linoleum table. 

             BILL
      This was when?

Violet stands smoking, unhappily watching Charlie and Mattie 
Fae climb into the Caddie and disappear down the gravel 
drive, heading back to Tulsa.

             VIOLET
      Saturday morning.  The Indian girl 
      made us biscuits and gravy.  We ate 
      some, he walked out the door, this 
      door right there.  Got into his 
      truck.  And that was it.

Johnna enters with her mint, crosses into the kitchen.

             BARBARA
      He just left...?

             VIOLET
      I went to bed Saturday night, got up 
      Sunday... still no Beverly.  I didnt 
      make much of it, thought hed gone 
      out on a bender.  

             BARBARA
      Why would he do that?  Not like he 
      couldnt drink at home.  Unless you 
      were riding his ass.

             VIOLET
      I never said anything to him about his 
      drinking, never got on him about it.

                                28.


             BARBARA
      Really.

             VILOET
      Barbara, I swear.  He could drink 
      himself into obliv-uh, obliv-en-um...

             BARBARA
      Oblivion. 

             BILL
      So Sunday, still no sign of him...

             VIOLET
      Yes, Sunday.  No sign. I started 
      getting worried, dontcha know.  
      Thats when I got worked up about 
      that safety deposit box.   We kept an 
      awful lot of cash in that box, some 
      expensive jewelry. I had a diamond 
      ring in that box appraised at seven 
      thousand dollars --

Johnna returns with glasses of iced tea, each with a sprig of 
mint, delivers them to Bill and Barbara.

             BARBARA
      Wait, wait, wait, Im missing 
      something.  Why do you care about a 
      safety deposit box?

             VIOLET
      Well, I know what youll say about 
      this, but, your father and I had an 
      urge-ment... arrangement.  If 
      something were to ever happen to one 
      of us, the other one would go empty 
      that box.

             BARBARA
      Because...

             BILL
      The money and jewelry gets rolled into 
      the estate, bank seals the box until 
      probate is settled.  Can take months.

             VIOLET
      Right, thats right --

             BARBARA
      Youre such a fucking cynic.

                                29.


             VIOLET
      I knew you would disapprove --

Johnna cuts into a freshly baked apple pie in the kitchen.

             BARBARA
      Okay, what about the safety deposit 
      box?

             VIOLET
      I had to wait for the bank to open on 
      Monday.  And after I emptied that box, 
      I called the police and reported him 
      missing.  Monday morning.

             BARBARA
      And you only had Ivy call me today?

             VIOLET
      I didnt want to worry you, honey --

	      BARBARA
	Jesus Christ.

		BILL
	Vi, you sure there wasnt 
        some event that triggered his 
        leaving, some incident.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      You mean like a fight.

Johnna places pieces of pie in front of Bill and Barb.

             BILL
      Yes.

             VIOLET
      No. And we fought enough... you 
      know... but no, he just left.

             BARBARA
      Maybe he needed some time away     
      from you.

             VIOLET
      Thats nice of you to say.

             BARBARA
      Good old unfathomable Dad.

             VIOLET
      Oh. That man. What I first fell of 
      with -- fell in love with, you know, 
      was his mystery.  I thought it was 
      sexy as hell.  

                                30.


             VIOLET
	(CONT'D)
      You knew he was the smartest one in 
      the room, knew if he just said 
      something... knock you out.  But hed 
      just stand there, little smile on his 
      face... not say a word.  Sexy.

INSIDE THE KITCHEN

                             INTERCUT WITH:

Ivy enters with her coffee cup, runs water in it at the sink. 
Outside, her mother, sister, and Bill on the back porch.

             BILL
      You cant think of anything unusual --

Johnna sits at the kitchen table behind Ivy.  Johnna stands, 
joins Ivy at the sink.  Ivy hadnt seen her there.

             VIOLET
      He hired this woman. He didnt ask me, 
      just hired this woman to come live in 
      our house. Few days before he left.

             BARBARA
      You dont want her here.

             VIOLET
      Shes a stranger in my house. Theres 
      an Indian in my house.

Ivy looks to Johnna, embarrassed.  But Johnna just takes 
Ivys cup from her, finishes cleaning it.

             BILL
      You have a problem with Indians, 
      Violet?

             VIOLET
      I dont know what to say to an 
      Indian.

             BARBARA
      Theyre called Native Americans    
      now, Mom.

             VIOLET
      Who makes that decision?

             BARBARA
      Its what they like to be called.

                                31.


             VIOLET
      They arent any more native than me.

             BARBARA
      In fact, they are.

             VIOLET
      Whats wrong with Indian?

             BARBARA
      Whys it so hard to call people --

             VIOLET
      Lets just call the dinosaurs Native 
      Americans while were at it.

             BARBARA
      She may be an Indian, but she makes 
      the best goddamn apple pie I ever ate.

Johnna smiles, nods to Ivy.  Leaves the kitchen.

             VIOLET
      He hired a cook. It doesnt make any 
      sense.  We dont eat.

             BARBARA
      And now you get biscuits and gravy. 
      Kind of nice, huh?

             VIOLET
      Nice for you, now. But youll be gone 
      soon enough, never to return.

             BARBARA
        (a warning)
      Mom...

             VIOLET
      When was the last time you were here?

      BARBARA
Dont get started on that --

VIOLET
Really, I dont even 
                     remember.

             BARBARA
      Im very dutiful, Mom, I call, I 
      write, I send presents -- 

             VIOLET
      You do not write --

                                32.


             BARBARA
      Presents on birthdays, Mothers Day --

Ivy eavesdrops at the sink, unsure if she should stay or go.

             VIOLET
      Because youre dutiful. 

             BILL
      All right, now --

             VIOLET
      I dont care about you two. Id like 
      to see my granddaughter every now --

             BARBARA
      Well, youre seeing her now.

             VIOLET
      But your father.  You broke his heart 
      when you moved away.

             BARBARA
      That is wildly unfair.

Bill stands, picks up a plate, pushes his way back into the 
kitchen.  Ivy hears him coming, but doesnt have time to 
escape.  Goes to the refrigerator instead.

	       BILL
	Am I going to have to 
	separate you two?

		VIOLET
	You know you were Beverlys 
	favorite; dont pretend you 
                     dont know that.  

Barbara follows Bill.  Ivy finds iced tea, pours herself 
some. Tries to make herself invisible -- its not hard to do.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      Id prefer to think my parents loved 
      all their children equally.

Violet trails behind them into the kitchen. 

             VIOLET
      Im sure youd prefer to think that 
      Santy Claus brought you presents at 
      Christmas, too.  If youd had more 
      than one child, youd know a parent 
      always has favorites.  Mattie Fae was 
      my mothers favorite.  Big deal. I got 
      used to it.  You were your Daddys 
      favorite.

                                33.


Barbara notices Ivy, standing there, Christ.  This isnt a 
conversation shed like to be having in front of her sister.  
Violet sees Ivy too -- could care less. 

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      Broke his heart.

             BARBARA
      What was I supposed to do?!  Colorado 
      gave Bill twice the money he was 
      making at TU --

             BILL
      Why are we even getting into this?

             BARBARA
      You think Daddy wouldnt have jumped 
      at the chance Bill got?

             VIOLET
      Youre wrong there. You never wouldve 
      gotten Beverly Weston out of Oklahoma.

             BARBARA
      Daddy gave me his blessing.

             VIOLET
      S what he told you. 

             BARBARA
      Now youre going to tell me the true 
      story, some terrible shit Daddy said 
      behind my back?

             BILL
      Hey, enough.  Everybodys on edge --

             VIOLET
      Beverly didnt say terrible things 
      behind your back --

             BILL
      Vi, come on --

             VIOLET
      He just told me hes disappointed in 
      you because you settled.  He thought 
      you had talent, as a writer.

             BARBARA
      Daddy never said anything like that  
      to you.  What a load of absolute 
      horseshit.

                                34.


             VIOLET
      Oh, horseshit, horseshit, lets all 
      say horseshit.  Say horseshit, Bill.

             BILL
      Horseshit.

Violet goes.  Barb and Bill exchange a look. Barb looks to 
Ivy, whos blank.  Barb takes a beat, follows Violet.  

INT. BATHROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Violet is closing the bathroom door.  Barb stops her.

             BARBARA
      Are you high?

             VIOLET
      Excuse me.

             BARBARA
      I mean literally.  You taking 
      something?

             VIOLET
      A muscle relaxer.

             BARBARA
      Listen to me: I will not go through 
      this with you again.

             VIOLET
      I dont know what youre talking 
      about.

             BARBARA
      These fucking pills?  Calls at three 
      AM about people in your backyard?

             VIOLET
      Stop yelling at me!

             BARBARA
      The police, all the rest of it?

             VIOLET
      Its not the same thing. I didnt have 
      a reason. 

             BARBARA
      So now its okay to get hooked because 
      you have a reason. 

                                35.


             VIOLET
      Im not hooked on anything.

             BARBARA
      I dont want to know if you are or 
      not, Im just saying I wont go --

             VIOLET
      Im not.  Im in pain.

             BARBARA
      Because of your mouth.

             VIOLET
      Yes, because my mouth burns from    
      the chemotheeeahh --

             BARBARA
      Are you in a lot of pain?

Violet starts to break down, sits on the lidded toilet.

             VIOLET
      Yes, Im in pain.  I have got... 
      gotten cancer.  In my mouth. And it 
      burns like a... bullshit.  And 
      Beverlys disappeared and youre 
      yelling at me.

             BARBARA
      Im not yelling at you.

             VIOLET
      You couldnt come home when I got 
      cancer but as soon as Beverly 
      disappeared you rushed back --

             BARBARA
      Im sorry... youre right. Im sorry.

Barbara kneels, takes her mothers hand.  

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      Know where I think he is?  I think he 
      got some whiskey, a carton of 
      cigarettes, and a couple of good spy 
      novels... I think he got out on the 
      boat, steered it to a nice spot, close 
      to shore... and hes fishing, and 
      reading, and drinking, maybe even 
      writing a little.  I think hell walk 
      right through that door any time.


                                36.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/STAIRS/ATTIC ROOM - TWILIGHT

Jean walks down the hall, perusing photos of her ancestors. 
Rail-thin, sunburned dust bowl farmers, WWII GIs standing in 
front of battered Packards before shipping out to die on the 
beaches of Normandy.  Violet and Bev on their wedding day. 
Jeans mother and aunts in grade school, with prom dates.

The photos end in a doorway that leads to a narrow, wooden 
staircase. Jean climbs it to --

INT. THE ATTIC BEDROOM - TWILIGHT

Finds Johnna on her bed in the small ascetic attic room, 
reading T.S. Eliot. Jean KNOCKS on the open door.

             JEAN
      Hi, again...  Am I bugging you?

             JOHNNA
      No, do you need something?

             JEAN
      No, I thought maybe youd like to 
      smoke a bowl with me?

             JOHNNA
      No, thank you.

             JEAN
      Okay.  I didnt know. 
        (beat)
      Do you mind if I smoke a bowl?

             JOHNNA
      I.  No, I --

             JEAN
      Mom and Dad dont mind.  You wont   
      get into trouble or anything.

Johnna is clearly a bit uncomfortable. But:

             JOHNNA
      Okay.

             JEAN
      Okay. You sure?

From her pocket, Jean takes a glass pipe and a bud.


                                37.


             JEAN
	(CONTD)
      I say they dont mind.  If they knew  
      I smuggled this on the plane? And sat 
      there sweating like in that movie 
      Midnight Express.  Did you see that?

             JOHNNA
      I dont think so.

             JEAN
      I just mean they dont mind that I 
      smoke pot.  Mom kind of does. I think 
      cause Dad smokes pot too, and she 
      wishes he didnt.
        (smokes, offers pipe)
      You sure?

             JOHNNA
      Yes.  No.  Im fine.

Jean notices a framed photo on the night stand.

             JEAN
      Wow, are those your parents?

             JOHNNA
      Mm-hm, their wedding picture.

             JEAN
      Their costumes are fantastic.  Are 
      they still together?

             JOHNNA
      My father passed away last year.

             JEAN
      Oh.  Sorry.  

             JOHNNA
      Thats okay.  Thank you.

             JEAN
      Were you close?

             JOHNNA
      Yes.  Very.

             JEAN
      My Mom and Dad are separated now.

             JOHNNA
      Im sorry.


                                38.


             JEAN
      Hes fucking one of his grad students.  
      I dont care --aside from the pathetic 
      English and Humanities cliche, like 
      all those departmental dicks fucking 
      their students -- he can fuck who he 
      wants and thats who teachers meet, 
      students.  He was just a turd the way 
      he didnt give Mom a chance to respond 
      or anything.  What sucks now is shes 
      on my ass cause shes afraid Ill have 
      some post-divorce freak-out and become 
      some heroin addict or shoot everybody 
      at school.  Or God forbid, lose my 
      virginity.  I dont know what it is 
      about Dad splitting that put Mom on 
      hymen patrol.
        (then)
      Dont say anything about Mom and Dad; 
      okay? They want to play it low key.

INT. BEVERLYS STUDY - NIGHT

Bill stands in Beverlys empty study. Absorbing the room, the 
man, the stillness.  Picks at the papers on the desk without 
specific purpose.  Turns to one of the many bookcases, 
eventually finds a book, smiles.

EXT. WESTON HOUSE FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Barbara sits on the front steps. Its dark now, but still 
very hot.  Moths bat at the porch lights.  Bill comes out 
carrying a Coke, shares it with Barb. 

             BILL
      Ivy leave?

             BARBARA
        (she nods)
      Id forgotten about the lightning 
      bugs.

Around the yard, flitting in and out of the low hanging 
boughs of the trees.

             BILL
      Look what I found...

She turns, he holds a thin hardback copy of Meadowlark.

                                39.


             BARBARA
      We have copies.

             BILL
      I dont remember a hardback edition.  
      Think this is worth something... first 
      edition, hardback, mint condition?  
      Academy Fellowship, Wallace Stevens 
      Award?  This book was a big deal.

             BARBARA
      It wasnt that big a deal.

             BILL
      In those circles, it was.

             BARBARA
      Those are small circles.

He opens the book, perusing the first pages.  Reads.

             BILL
      Dedicated to my Violet. Thats nice.  
      Christ, probably every word he wrote 
      after this he had to be thinking, 
      What are they going to say, are they 
      going to compare it to Meadowlark?

             BARBARA
      Jean go to bed?

             BILL
      Just turned out the light.  Youd 
      think at some point, you just write 
      something anyway and who cares what 
      they say about it.  I dont know --

             BARBARA
      Will you shut up about that fucking 
      book?!  You are just dripping with 
      envy over these thirty poems my father 
      wrote back in the late sixties, for 
      Gods sake.  Yhear yourself?

Bills taken aback, but doesnt want to overreact. 

             BILL
      I have great admiration for these 
      poems --


                                40.


             BARBARA
      My father didnt write anymore for a 
      lot of reasons, but critical opinion 
      was not one of them, hard as that may 
      be for you to believe.  

             BILL
      What are you attacking me for?  I 
      havent done anything.

             BARBARA
      Im sure thats what you tell Sissy, 
      too, so she can comfort you, reassure 
      you, No, Billy, you havent done 
      anything.

             BILL
      Why are you bringing that up?

             BARBARA
      Theyre all symptoms of your male 
      menopause, whether its you  
      struggling with the creative 
      question, or screwing a girl who 
      still wears a retainer.

             BILL
      All right, look, Im not going to be 
      held hostage here while you attack  
      me.  And her name is Cindy.

             BARBARA
      I know her stupid name -- do me the 
      courtesy of recognizing when Im 
      demeaning you.

             BILL
      Violet really has a way of putting  
      you in attack mode, you know that?    
      You feel such rage for her you    
      cant help dishing it --

             BARBARA
      Psychoanalyze me right now, I skin 
      you.

             BILL
      You may not agree with my methods,  
      but you know Im right --

                                41.


             BARBARA
      Your methods.  Thank you, Doctor, 
      but I actually dont need any help 
      from my mother to feel rage.

             BILL
      You want to argue?  Is that what you 
      need to do?  Pick a subject, alright, 
      let me know what it is, so I have a 
      fighting --

             BARBARA
      The subject is me!  I am the subject, 
      you narcissistic motherfucker!  I am 
      in pain! I need help!

Barbara heads into the yard to get away from him.

INT. WESTON HOUSE, UPSTAIRS ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Jeans on the small bed in the darkened room. Staring at the 
ceiling, listening to her parents argue.

EXT. WESTON HOUSE FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

Bill chases Barbara into the yard.

             BILL
      Ive copped to being a narcissist.  
      Were the products of a narcissistic 
      generation.

             BARBARA
      You cant do it, can you?  You cant  
      talk about me for two seconds --

             BILL
      You called me a narcissist!

             BARBARA
      You do understand that it hurts,     
      to go from sharing a bed with you   
      for twenty-three years to sleeping   
      by myself.

             BILL
      Im here, now.

                                42.


             BARBARA
      Oh, men always say shit like that,   
      as if the past and the future dont 
      exist.

Jean listens in the dark to her parents fighting -- as she 
has many times before.  Heads out into the hallway to screen 
door leading to the upstairs porch. 

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      Its just horseshit, to avoid   
      talking about the things theyre 
      afraid to say.

             BILL
      Im not necessarily keen on the notion 
      of saying things that would hurt you.

             BARBARA
      Like what?

             BILL
      We have enough on our hands with your 
      parents right now, lets not revisit 
      this.

             BARBARA
      When did we visit this to begin with? 
      I still dont know what happened.  Do 
      I bore you, intimidate you, disgust 
      you?  Is this just about the pleasures 
      of young flesh, teenage pussy?  I 
      really need to know.

             BILL
      You need to know now?  With Beverly 
      missing, and your mother crazy as a 
      loon?  You want to do this now?

             BARBARA
      Youre right.  Ill just hunker down 
      for a cozy nights sleep upstairs. 
      Next to my husband.

             BILL
      This discussion deserves our care.  
      And patience.  Well both be in a 
      better frame of mind to talk about 
      this once your fathers come home.

Bill turns, starts back for the house.


                                43.
INT. WESTON HOUSE BEDROOM - NIGHT

Jean sees her father coming, hears his footsteps approaching 
across the wooden porch below, the screen door opens quietly.  
She slips back into her room and bed, but he doesnt stop. 

Jean waits, listening for her mother.  She doesnt come.

EXT. SKIATOOK LAKE - NIGHT

Were on the old wooden dock, watching a man walking away 
from us toward an aluminum rowboat tied haphazardly to the 
dock in the moonlight.  He leans down to untie the boat, 
looks back at us, directly into camera -- Beverly.

Now were traveling BELOW the surface of the lake, through 
its dark, tenebrous waters on the moonlit night.  The 
rhythmic SLAP of gentle waves. Were underwater, light 
fractures and scatters above us.  Weve been here before as --

A rowboat SLIPS across our field of vision.  Its aluminum 
bottom cuts through the calm above.

Oars dip on either side, propelling the small craft. It 
slows. Stops. Bobs gently. We wait, watch -- 

Until, suddenly, something hits the surface above, exploding 
the calm, coming at us fast, sinking.

INT. THE ATTIC - NIGHT

Johnna wakes with a start. Sits up, listens intently.

EXT. WESTON HOUSE - NIGHT  

Johnna steps out onto the second floor porch balcony, finds a  
police car approaching in the distance, headlights cutting 
through the dark country night.

INT. WESTON HOUSE STAIRWAY - NIGHT

Barefoot, Johnna quietly descends the stairs.  Approaches the 
front door, left open to let in the cool night air.  Undoes 
the screen door latch.  Steps outside.   

Watches the car arrive.  The drivers door opens, a sheriff 
gets out, silhouetted against the police flashers behind him.


                                44.
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Barbara, bleary-eyed, moves quickly down the dark hall in  
her robe.  Bill follows in his boxers and T-shirt, pulling   
on pants.  Barb goes to Vis door, KNOCKS.

             BARBARA
      Mom?

She opens the door.  Over her we FIND: Violet, entombed in 
her room.  Squinting against the intrusive hall light.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      Mom, wake up, the sheriffs here.

             VIOLET
      Did you call them?  I dig in call 
      them.

             BARBARA
      Mom.  The sheriff is here.

             VIOLET
      Inna esther?

             BARBARA
      What?

             VIOLET
      Inna esther broke.  N pays me 
      em...sturck...struck.

             BILL
      Come on.  Leave her there.

Barbara does, starts for the staircase, meets the just 
awakened Jean coming out of her room, concerned.

             BILL
	(CONTD)
      Go back to bed, sweetheart....

Barbara descends the stairs, trailed by Bill. The SHERIFF 
waits on the porch, late-forties, handsome, Stetson in hand. 

They go to him, but WE HANG BACK with Jean, watching the 
scene outside unfold. Bill shakes the Sheriffs hand. The 
Sheriff speaks earnestly to Barbara and Bill. 

We cant hear whats being said, only murmurs until -- 
Barbara sinks to her knees.  Bill holds her.  Jean watches.


                                45.
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Johnna enters, snaps on the light, starts a pot of coffee.  
Stoic, inscrutable.

EXT. WESTON HOUSE DRIVEWAY - JUST BEFORE DAWN

A big pre-dawn sky is changing from black to blue.  The 
Sheriff walks to his cruiser, kills the flashers.  Bill joins 
him, still barefoot.

             BILL
      What happened?

             SHERIFF
      Couple old boys running jug lines in 
      the lake hooked him.  Pulled him up.

             BILL
      He drowned.  Thats how he died, from 
      drowning?

             SHERIFF
      Looks it.  Yes, sir.

Bill looks off.  Song birds begin their pre-dawn chatter. 

             BILL
      Is there any way to determine if  
      he... I mean is this an accident,    
      or suicide --?

             SHERIFF
      Theres really no way to tell.

             BILL
      Whats your guess?

             SHERIFF
      ...Suicide.  

And now the full weight of it hits Bill. After a moment --

             BILL
      How does a a person jump in the 
      water... and choose not to swim?

INT. WESTON GIRLS BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN

Barb pulls on clothes, rakes a brush through her hair. Jean 
appears in the door, watches her.  After a moment:

                                46.


             JEAN
      What about Aunt Ivy?

             BARBARA 
      I guess well stop on the way.  
      Christ, I need to call Karen, too.  
      Why the fuck am I brushing my hair?

She drops the brush.  And then an odd sound intrudes from 
downstairs, a song: Lay Down, Sally by Eric Clapton.

INT. LIVING ROOM - PRE-DAWN 

The music is LOUD.  We follow Barbara and Jean halfway down 
the stairs to REVEAL: Violet, high as a kite, doing a jerky 
little dance by the stereo.  The Sheriff stands uncomfortably 
by the door, his hat in hand. She shuffles over to him.

             VIOLET
      Izza story.  Barelys back.  Did sum 
      Beer-ley come home?

             SHERIFF
      Maam?

             VIOLET
      Gizza cig... some cigezze?  Cig-zezz, 
      cig-zizz... cig-uhzzz...

She laughs at her inability to speak. He takes a Pall Mall 
from his shirt pocket, hands it to her.  Lights it for her.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      In the archa, archa-tex?  Im in    
      the bottom.  Inna bottom of them.  
        (and)
      Mm, good beat, right?

He nods.  Bill comes back in from outside.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      Barbara?! Is Barbara here?!

             BARBARA
        (quietly)
      Right here, Mom...

Johnna steps in from the kitchen, pensively observing.

             VIOLET
      Mm, good beat, right?  Idnt its a 
      good beat?  

                                47.


             VIOLET
	(CONT'D)
      Mmmm, I been on the music... pell man 
      onna sheriff. Armen in tandel 
      slossle, slost? Lost?! From the day, 
      the days. Am Beerly... and Beverly 
      lost?

Violet abandons her dance, separates invisible threads in the 
air.  The others stand frozen, staring at her.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      And then youre here. And Barbara, and 
      then youre here, and Beverly, and 
      then youre here, and then youre 
      here, and then youre here, and then 
      youre here, and then youre here...

EXT. SKIATOOK LAKE ROAD - DAWN

The suns just topped the horizon, throws long early shadows 
across the flat expanse of prairie.  Scattered trees, a 
ribbon of asphalt leading to a distant lake, telephone poles. 

Were HIGH ABOVE the country road, following the Sheriff 
cruiser below.  Barbs rental sedan trails behind. 

             BARBARA
	(OS)
      I used to go out with that boy.     
      That man.

INT. RENTAL CAR (MOVING) - EARLY MORNING

Bill drives, Ivy up front with him.  Barbara sits in the back 
with Jean.  Watches the sheriffs car ahead.

             JEAN
      What man? The Sheriff?

             BARBARA
      In high school. He was my prom date.

             JEAN
      Youre kidding.

             BARBARA
      Day of the prom, his father got   
      drunk and stole his car, stole his  
      own sons car, went somewhere, Mexico. 
      Deon showed up at the door. Hed been 
      crying.  Confessed he didnt have a 
      way to take me to the prom. 

                                48.


The cruiser slows, pulls through a pipe gate and over a 
cattle-crossing, heads for a small collection of emergency 
vehicles parked around a brush-strewn cove. Bevs old Chevy 
pick-up truck sits to one side.

             BARBARA
	(CONT'D)
      So we got a six-pack and broke into 
      the chapel, stayed up all night 
      talking and kissing.  Now here he    
      is, showing me --
        (fights her emotions)
      Its so surreal.  Thank God we cant 
      tell the future.  Wed never get out 
      of bed.

The cars stop.  The Sheriff gets out.  

             BILL
      Let me go first, see what they need.

Bill goes.  Barb fixes Jean with a look.

             BARBARA
      Listen to me: die after me, all right?  
      I dont care what else you do, where 
      you go, how you screw up your life, 
      just... survive.  Outlive me, please.

They watch the men. A resolute Bill returns to get Barbara 
and Ivy.  The sisters climb out, follow him to the waters 
edge.  Jean waits a moment, then steps out of the car. 

Watches her father lead her mother down the small cracked 
concrete boat ramp to where the Sheriff waits by a covered 
body.  As the Sheriff pulls back the tarp --

INT. A STERILE ROOM - DAY

White walls, bright overhead light.  Were CLOSE on a mans 
pale, lifeless hand.  Another hand enters frame with a 
sponge, begins cleaning off the mud, filth.

EXT. WESTON HOUSE - DAY

The Weston clan walks to Beverlys Lincoln, Bill, Jean.  Barb 
and Ivy help a distraught Violet.  All wear mourning black.

INT. THE STERILE ROOM - DAY

Beverlys sodden shoes are removed, his socks.

                                49.


His limp, greyish arm is guided into a starched white shirt-
sleeve.  The buttons carefully buttoned.

INT. BEVERLYS CAR (MOVING) - DAY

Bill drives. Jean beside him. Barbara and Ivy sit in the back 
seat, flanking Violet.  They ride in silence.  We study their 
faces, the brown countryside outside. 

Bill notices something in his rearview, a red speck, coming 
up fast, very fast.  A sports car.

Its suddenly right behind them, filling his mirrors. It 
waits for a semi loaded down with massive circular hay bales 
to pass in the opposite lane, then -- 

ROARS around.  A Ferrari, its throaty V-10 RUMBLING as it 
SCREAMS past, accelerates down the road.  Bill and Jean 
exchange a look, watch it disappear.

INT. THE STERILE ROOM - DAY

Strong male hands lift Beverlys now dressed body carefully 
and place it into the casket.  Adjust the pillow, comb his 
hair into place, fold his hands across his chest.

We never see his face, never see his whole body. Only these 
small, intimate pieces.

INT/EXT. CAR/FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH OF PAWHUSKA - DAY

A few mourners enter the church as Bill pulls in to park, 
discovers the Ferrari already there.  A woman emerging. 

             BARBARA
      Holy shit, thats Karen.

KAREN WESTON, forty, lithe, climbing from the car.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      Do you remember your Aunt Karen?

             JEAN
      Kind of...

STEVE HEIDEBRECHT, fifty, greying, athletic, tan and 
handsome, gets out of the drivers side.

             BARBARA
      That must be this years man.

                                50.


Mattie Fae and Charlie are waiting for them, start over as 
Violet emerges into the blinding sun.  Recoils slightly. 
Mattie Fae catches her, whispers comforts into her ear, helps 
her toward the church steps. 

We stay back, watching the Westons enter the church --

             KAREN (VO)
      I spent so much time in our bedroom 
      pretending my pillow was my husband 
      and did he like the dinner I made and 
      where were we going to vacation that 
      winter and hed surprise me with 
      tickets to Belize and wed kiss.

INT. BEVERLYS LINCOLN (MOVING) - AFTERNOON

Barbara drives, Karen beside her.  Heat radiates off the 
road.  They follow Charlies Caddie, Vi and Ivy visible in 
the Caddies back seat window ahead of us. 

             KAREN
      I mean Id kiss my pillow, and then 
      Id tell him Id been to the doctor 
      that day and Id found out I was 
      pregnant.  I know how pathetic that 
      sounds, but it was innocent enough.  
      Then real life takes over, cause it 
      always does --

             BARBARA
      -- uh-huh --

Here comes the red speck in the rearview again.  The Ferrari 
ROARS up behind them, pulls around to pass,  HONKS as it 
goes.  Barb catches a glimpse of Jean in the passenger seat, 
Bill jammed into the tiny back seat. 

             KAREN
      Things dont work out like you 
      planned.  That pillow was a better 
      husband than any real man Id ever 
      met; this parade of men fails to live 
      up to your expectations, all of them 
      so much less than Daddy or Bill.  You 
      punish yourself, tell yourself its 
      your fault you cant find a good one. 
      I dont know how well you remember 
      Andrew...

             BARBARA
      No, I remember.


                                51.


             KAREN
      I loved him so intensely, so the 
      things he did wrong were just 
      opportunities for me to make things 
      right.  If he cheated on me or called 
      me a cunt, Id think No, love is 
      forever, so heres an opportunity to 
      make an adjustment in the way you  
      view the world.

The AC isnt working, Barbs sweating, rolls down her window, 
lets the wind whip her hair around.

             KAREN
	(CONTD)
      And thank God one day I looked in the 
      mirror and said, Moron, and walked 
      out, but it kicked off this whole 
      period of reflection, how hard I had 
      screwed it up, whered I go wrong.  
      Thats when I got into those books  
      and discussion groups --

             BARBARA
      And Scientology too, right, or 
      something like that --?

             KAREN
      Exactly, and finally one day, I threw 
      it all out, I said, Its me, just me 
      with my music on the stereo, my glass 
      of wine and Bloomers my cat.  I dont 
      need anything else, I can live my life 
      with myself.  I got my license, threw 
      myself into my work, sold a lot of 
      houses, and thats when I met Steve.

Charlie slows, signals, turns onto the gravel road leading to 
the Weston house.  Barb follows, Karen still going strong --

             KAREN
	(CONT'D)
      Thats how it works, you only find   
      it when youre not looking, you turn 
      around and there it is: Steve. Ten 
      years older than me, but a thinker, 
      and hes just so good.  Hes a good 
      man and hes good to me and hes good 
      for me.

INT. WESTON HOUSE STAIRWAY/UPSTAIRS HALL - AFTERNOON

Barbara leads Karen upstairs, Karen carries her suitcase, 
Barbara carries Steves.  Karens still talking.

                                52.


             KAREN
      The best thing about him, for me, is 
      that now what I think about is now.  
      I live now.  My focus, my life, my 
      world is now.  I dont give a care 
      about the past anymore, the mistakes 
      I made, the way I thought.  And you 
      cant plan the future cause as soon 
      as you do, something happens, some 
      terrible thing happens --

             BARBARA
      Like your father drowning himself.

They enter a bedroom, dump the luggage on the bed.

             KAREN
      Thats exactly what I mean. You take 
      it as it comes, here and now!  Steve 
      had a huge presentation today for some 
      big-wig government guys who could be 
      important for his business, something 
      hes put together for months, and as 
      soon as we heard about Daddy, he 
      cancelled his meeting. He has his 
      priorities straight. And you know what 
      the kicker is?
        (beat)
      Do you know what the kicker --?

Barbara heads for the fan on the dresser, flips it on.

             BARBARA
      Whats the kicker?

             KAREN
      Were going to Belize on our 
      honeymoon!

Barb sticks her face into the fan. Karen watches, what?

             BARBARA
      Sorry.  Hot flash.

INT. VIOLETS BEDROOM - DAY

Violet pulls a dress from the closet; Mattie Fae sits, 
rooting through a box of photos; Ivy stands by the door.

             VIOLET
      It wont kill you to try it on --

                                53.


             MATTIE FAE
      Oh, this is a sweet one, Vi --

             IVY
      I find this a tidge morbid, frankly --

	     MATTIE FAE
	Look at this, Ivy --

		VIOLET
	Whats morbid about it? 

             IVY
	(CONTD)
      Its not my style, Mom.

             VIOLET
      You dont have a style, thats the 
      point.

             MATTIE FAE
      Where was this taken?

             VIOLET
      New York.  On the first book tour.

             IVY
      I dont have your style, I have a 
      style of my own.

             VIOLET
      You wore a suit to your fathers 
      funeral. A woman doesnt wear a suit 
      to a funeral.

             IVY
      God, youre weird; its a black suit.

             VIOLET
      You look like a magicians assistant.

             MATTIE FAE
      Little Charles has been talking about 
      moving to New York.  Can you picture 
      that?

             VIOLET
      Dont discourage him now --

             MATTIE FAE
      He wouldnt last a day in that city.  
      Theyd tear him apart.

		  MATTIE FAE
	(CONTD)
	I could kill that kid --

		IVY
	Why do you feel it necessary 
        to insult me?

                                54.


             VIOLET
      Stop being so sensitive.

             MATTIE FAE
      He overslept?  For his Uncles 
      funeral?  A noon service?

             IVY
      Im sure theres more to the story --

             MATTIE FAE
      Dont make excuses for him. Thats 
      what Charlie does.  Thirty-seven years 
      old and cant drive?  Who cant drive?

Violet pulls more and more clothes from the closet, dumping 
them on the bed. The pile is getting very large.

             MATTIE FAE
	(CONTD)
      Ive seen a chimp drive.

             IVY
      Why are you giving away your clothes?

             VIOLET
      All this shits going. I dont plan  
      to spend the rest of my days looking 
      at what used to be. I want that shit 
      in the office gone, I want these 
      clothes Im never going to wear gone. 
      I mean look at these fucking shoes -- 
        (holds up spiked heels)
      Even if I didnt fall on my face, can 
      you imagine anything less attractive, 
      my swollen ankles and varicose veins? 
      And my toenails, good God: anymore 
      they could dig through cement.

INT. THE KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Johnnas at the sink, washing and breaking beans, every 
kitchen surface is covered with the large dinner shes 
preparing.  Barbara enters, Karen still pursuing her.

             KAREN
      You get a read off Steve?  Did      
      you like him?

             BARBARA
      We said two words to each other --

                                55.


             KAREN
      You get a feel, though, dont you?  
      Did you get a feel?

             BARBARA
      He seemed very nice, sweetheart --

Barb grabs a glass from the cabinet, opens the freezer for 
ice, lets her head linger in the cold. 

             KAREN
      He is, and --

             BARBARA
      -- but what I think doesnt matter. 
      Im not marrying him --

             KAREN
      I guess what Im telling you is that 
      Im happy. Ive been unhappy most of 
      my life,   my adult life.  I doubt 
      youve been aware of that.  I know our 
      lives have led us apart, you, me and 
      Ivy.  Maybe were not as close as, as 
      close as some families --

Barb gives up on the freezer, fills her glass with iced tea.

             BARBARA
      Yeah, we really need to talk about 
      Mom, what to do about Mom --

             KAREN
      -- but I think I havent wanted to 
      live my unhappiness in view of my 
      family.  But now Im just really 
      happy.  Id like us to get to know  
      each other a little better.

Barbara stares at her, what is she talking about?

             BARBARA
      Yes.  Yes.

Karen wraps her arms around Barbara.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      Okay.  Yes.


                                56.
EXT. PAWHUSKA LIQUOR STORE PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

The Ferrari pulls into the lot.  Bill crawls out, heads for 
the store.  An anxious Jean calls after him.

             JEAN
      Hurry, okay?

             BILL
      I will, sweetheart.

Steve joins Jean, leans against the car.  Throughout the 
following they watch Bill shop for wine inside.

             STEVE
      Is it always this hot?

             JEAN
      Usually its hotter.

             STEVE
      Hard to imagine. 
        (a beat)
      How old are you, about, seventeen?

             JEAN
      Fourteen.

             STEVE
      Fourteen, right... Know what I was 
      doing when I was fourteen?  Cattle 
      processing. Know what that is?

             JEAN
      It doesnt sound good.

             STEVE
      Slaughterhouse sanitation.

             JEAN
      Thats disgusting.

             STEVE
      I dont recommend it.  But hey.     
      Put food on the table.  Get it?

An impatient Jean watches her father comparing wines inside.

             STEVE
	(CONTD)
      Whats that smell?

She sniffs. Doesnt smell much of anything really.

                                57.


             JEAN
      Dumpster over there?

             STEVE
      Nah, thats not what Im smelling.

He sniffs the air, then sniffs her.

             JEAN
      What are you doing?

             STEVE
      Do I smell what I think I smell?

             JEAN
      What do you smell?

             STEVE
      What do you think I smell?

             JEAN
      I think you smell that dumpster.

He whiffs, hard, breathing her in.

             STEVE
      Is that... pot? You smoking pot?

             JEAN
      No.

             STEVE
      You can tell me.

             JEAN
      No.

             STEVE
      You a little dope smoker?
        (beat)
      Then you are in luck.  Because I  
      just happen to have some tasty shit.  
      And I am going to hook you up.

Bill pays inside, motions to Jean that hes hurrying.

             JEAN
      Thatd be so great.  I just smoked my 
      last bowl and I really need to get 
      fucked up.

             STEVE
      You what?


                                58.


             JEAN
      I really need to get fucked up --

             STEVE
      You need to get what?

             JEAN
      Youre bad --

Bill hustles out of the store, carrying several bags.

             BILL
      No Pinots, but they had some decent 
      California Merlots.

Crawls into the car.  Steve grins to Jean over the roof of 
the car, climbs in behind the wheel.

INT. VIOLETS BEDROOM - DAY

The closet is mostly empty now, the bed overflowing with 
discarded clothes.  Mattie Fae nurses a cocktail, hands a 
photo to Violet.

             VIOLET
      Look at me.
        (shows photo to Ivy)
      Look at me.

             IVY
      Youre beautiful, Mom.

             VIOLET
      I was beautiful.  Not anymore.

	     MATTIE FAE 
	Oh, now --

		IVY
	Youre still beautiful.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      One of those lies we tell to give us 
      comfort.  Women are beautiful when 
      theyre young and not after. Men can 
      still preserve their sex appeal into 
      old age.  Not those men like you see 
      with shorts and those little purses 
      around their waists.  Some men can 
      maintain a weary masculinity.  Women 
      just get old and fat and wrinkly.

             MATTIE FAE
      I beg your pardon?

                                59.


             VIOLET
      Think about the last time you went to 
      the mall and saw some sweet little gal 
      and thought shes a cute trick.  What 
      makes her that way?  Taut skin, firm 
      boobs, an ass above her knees.

             MATTIE FAE
      Im still very sexy, thank you very 
      much.

             VIOLET
      Youre about as sexy as a wet card-
      board box, Mattie Fae, you and me 
      both.  Look, wouldnt we be better off 
      if we stopped lying about these things 
      and told the truth? Women arent sexy 
      when theyre old.  I can live with 
      that.  Can you live with that?

             MATTIE FAE
      What about Sophia Loren?  What about 
      Lena Horne?  She stayed sexy till   
      she was eighty.

Violet finds something else in the closet for Ivy to try.

             VIOLET
      The world is round.  Get over it.    
      Now try this dress on.

             IVY 
      Im sorry, I wont.

             VIOLET
      You dont know how to attract a man.  
      I do.  Thats something I always -- 

             IVY
      We just buried my father, Im not 
      trying to attract --!

             VIOLET
      Im not talking about today, dummy, 
      this is something you can wear --

             IVY
      I have a man.  All right?  I have     
      a man.

             VIOLET
      You said you werent looking for      
      a man --

                                60.


             IVY
      And Im not.  Because I have one.  
      Okay?  Now will you leave it alone?

	       VIOLET
	No, I wont leave it alone.

		MATTIE FAE
	No, lets not leave it alone.

             IVY
	(CONTD)
      I wish you both could see the 
      brainsick looks on your faces --

             VIOLET
      Who is it?

             IVY
      Nobody.  Forget it --

             MATTIE FAE
      Tell us, is he someone from school?  
      How old is he, whats he do --?

             IVY
      Im not telling you anything so --

             MATTIE FAE
      You have to tell us something!

             IVY
      No, I really dont.

             VIOLET
      Are you in love, Ivy?

             IVY
      I...I dont...Im...

Ivy bursts into awkward laughter, Vi and Mattie squeal.

EXT. WESTON HOUSE - AFTERNOON

The Ferrari ROARS up the drive.  Jean jumps out, races into 
the house.  Bill and Steve emerge, grab the wine.

             STEVE
      No, we maintain the accounts off-
      shore, just until we get approvals.

             BILL
      To get around approvals?


                                61.


             STEVE
      To get around approvals until we get 
      approvals.  Theres a lot of red tape, 
      bureaucracy, I dont know how much you 
      know about Florida, Florida politics --

             BILL
      Only what I read and thats --

             STEVE
      Right, right, this kind of business  
      in particular.

Charlie, keys in hand, comes out, heading for his Caddie.

             BILL
      ...Charlie?

             CHARLIE
      Picking up Little Charles.

Charlie climbs in behind the wheel, pulls away.

             STEVE
      Little Charles?

             BILL
      His son.  Im sorry, what is your 
      business again?

They start up the porch steps with the wine.

             STEVE
      You know, its essentially security 
      work. The situation in the Middle East 
      is perpetually dangerous, so theres a 
      tremendous amount of money involved.

             BILL
      Security work.  You mean... mercenary?

INT. KITCHEN/WESTON LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Bill and Steve enter.  Barbaras in the dining room with 
Karen and Mattie Fae setting the table.  Goes for the men.

             BARBARA
      Give.  Me.  The wine.

She pulls a bottle of Merlot from Bills grocery bag.  Hears 
something, looks into the living room as she passes.  Jean 
has just turned on the TV, LOUD.  Barbara stares for a beat.  


                                62.


             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      Is that what you were in such a hurry 
      to get home for?  What the hells on 
      TV thats so important you?

             JEAN
      Phantom of the Opera, 1925.

             BARBARA
      For Gods sake, you can get it at   
      any Blockbuster.

             JEAN
      Theyre showing it with the scene    
      in color restored. 

Steves appeared in the living room archway.

             STEVE
      Cool.

             BARBARA
      Let me make sure Ive got this: when 
      you threw a fit about going to the 
      store with your dad... Hey, look at 
      me.

        (Jean does)
      And you were so distraught over the 
      start time of your Grandpas funeral.  
      Was this your concern?  Getting back 
      here in time to watch Phantom of the 
      Fucking Opera?

             JEAN
      I guess.

Barb gives Jean a withering look, exits.  Bill takes the wine 
from Steve, follows.  Steve lingers, watching the TV.

             STEVE
      Phantom of the Opera, huh?

             JEAN
      Huh-uh.

Karen enters from the dining room, sidles up to Steve.

             KAREN
      Hi, doodle.

             STEVE
        (focused on the TV)
      Hey, baby.

                                63.


             KAREN
        (in super-baby-voice)
      Hi, doodle!

Steve turns to her, embraces her.  They kiss.  His hands 
wander, squeeze her ass.  She giggles, then breaks it.  

             KAREN
	(CONTD)
      Come on, I want to show you our     
      old fort.  Man, the air in here    
      just doesnt move.

She goes.  He starts, but stops.  Quietly to Jean:

             STEVE
      Hook you up, later.

INT/EXT. GREYHOUND BUS/PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

Were inside the bus, sitting next to a man, LITTLE CHARLES, 
thirty-seven, rangy and awkward.  He stares pensively out at 
the passing Pawhuska storefronts as the bus SLOWS, pulls into 
a parking lot next to the bank.

He spots Charlie, waiting, drinking a Coke.  Little Charles 
exhales, stands.  Steps reluctantly out into the heat. 

             LITTLE CHARLES
      Im sorry, Dad.

             CHARLIE
      No need to apologize.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      I know Moms mad at me.

             CHARLIE
      Dont worry about her.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      What did she say?

             CHARLIE
      Your mother, she says what she says.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      I set the alarm.  I did.

             CHARLIE
      I know you did.

                                64.


             LITTLE CHARLES
      I loved Uncle Bev, you know that.

             CHARLIE
      Stop apologizing. 

             LITTLE CHARLES
      The power mustve gone out.  I woke  
      up and the clock was blinking noon. 
      That means the power went out, right?

             CHARLIE
      Its okay.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      I missed his funeral!

             CHARLIE
      Its a ceremony.  Its ceremonial.   
      It doesnt mean anything compared    
      to what you have in your heart.
        (and, then)
      Hold on, comb your hair.

Charlie hands Little Charles his comb.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      Uncle Bev must be disappointed in me.

             CHARLIE
      Your Uncle Bev has got bigger and 
      better things ahead of him.  He 
      doesnt have time for spite.  He 
      wasnt that kind of man anyway --

Charlie starts for the drivers side, stops when he sees 
Little Charles weeping.  Returns to him, comforts him.

             CHARLIE
	(CONTD)
      Hey, hey. Its okay. Its okay, now...

             LITTLE CHARLES
      Just... I know how things are.  I  
      know how they feel about me and 
      something like this... you want to be 
      there for people, and I missed Uncle 
      Bevs funeral, and I know how they 
      feel about me --

             CHARLIE
      How who feels about you?  Feels what  
      about you?

                                65.


             LITTLE CHARLES
      All of them.  I know what they say.

             CHARLIE
      They dont say things about you --

             LITTLE CHARLES
      I see how they are. I dont blame 
      them.  Im sorry I let you down, Dad.

             CHARLIE
      You havent let me down.  You never 
      let me down.  Now listen...youre 
      wrong about these people, they love 
      you.  Some of them havent gotten a 
      chance to see what I see: a fine man, 
      very loving, with a lot to offer.  Now 
      take this...
        (a handkerchief)
      Give me my comb.  Stand up straight, 
      look folks in the eye.  Stop being so 
      hard on yourself.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      I love you, Dad.

             CHARLIE
      Love you too, son.

EXT. WESTON BACKYARD - AFTERNOON

Barbara bursts out of the back porch screen and into the 
yard, heading to the old barn.  Bill follows.

             BARBARA
      Phantom of the Opera --

             BILL
      You dont remember what it was like to 
      be fourteen?

             BARBARA
      Shes old enough to exhibit a little 
      character.  But thats something you 
      normally learn from your parents.

             BILL
      Thats a shot across my bow, right?      
      I missed something.

                                66.


             BARBARA
      Really? Instilling character: our   
      burden as parents.

             BILL
      I got that part.

             BARBARA
      And you really havent been much of a 
      parent lately, so its tough to --

             BILL
      Just because you and I are struggling 
      with this Gordian knot doesnt mean --

             BARBARA
      Nice, Gordian knot, but her fourteen-
      year-old self might view it differently, 
      might consider it abandonment --

             BILL
      Oh, come on, shes a little more 
      sophisticated than that, dont you 
      think?

Barbara kicks at an old, stuck, door.  Enters --

INT. THE WORKSHOP AT THE BACK OF THE BARN - DAY

Makes her way to the back where old dinner chairs hang from 
nails pounded into the overhead beams.

             BARBARA
      Pretty fucking sophisticated, the 
      restored whatever from Phantom of   
      the Opera, I know that makes your   
      dick hard --

             BILL
      Barbara --

             BARBARA
      Precocious little shit.

             BILL
      Im not defending her.


                                67.


	      BARBARA
	(voice rising)
	Im not blaming her, because 
	I dont expect her to act any 
	differently when her father 
	is a selfish son-of-a-bitch.

		BILL
	(voice rising)
	Im on your side.  How can we 
	fight when Im on your side?  
	Barbara...Barbara, settle 
	down!

             BARBARA
      Be a father!  Help me!

             BILL
      I am her father, goddamn it!

             BARBARA
      Her father in name only!

             BILL
      I have not forsook my 
      responsibilities!

Barbara hands dusty battered chairs back to Bill.

             BARBARA
      Its forsaken, big shot!

             BILL
      Actually, forsook is also an  
      acceptable usage --!

             BARBARA
      Oh, forsook you and the horse     
      you rode in on --

Each now with chairs in hand, head out into --

EXT. THE BACK YARD - DAY

And the blinding sunlight.  Start back for the house.

             BILL
      You dont fight fair.

             BARBARA
      Ive seen where that gets me! Im 
      sick of the whole notion of the 
      enduring female.  GROW UP!  Cause 
      while youre going through your fifth 
      puberty, the world is falling apart 
      and your kid cant handle it!

                                68.


             BILL
      Our kid is just trying to deal with 
      this goddamn madhouse youve dragged 
      her into.

             BARBARA
      This madhouse is my home.

             BILL
      Think about that statement for a 
      second, why dont you?

             BARBARA
      Jean is here with me because this     
      is a family event.

             BILL
      Jeans here with you because shes    
      a buffer between you and the shrill 
      insanity of your mother. 

             BARBARA
      Yknow, youd have a lot more 
      credibility if you had any 
      credibility.

             BILL
      You cant resist, can you?

             BARBARA
      Youre a pretty easy mark.

             BILL
      Youre so goddamn self-righteous,   
      you know?  Youre so --

             BARBARA
      Surely you mustve known when you 
      started porking Pippi Longstocking  
      you were due for a little self-
      righteousness, just a smidge of 
      indignation on my part --

             BILL
      Maybe I split because of it.

Theyve reached the back porch stairs. She turns on him.

             BARBARA
      Is this your confession, then, when 
      you finally unload all?

                                69.


             BILL
      Youre thoughtful, Barbara, but youre 
      not open.  Youre passionate, but 
      youre hard.  Youre a good, decent, 
      funny, wonderful woman, and I love 
      you, but youre a pain in the ass.

Bill pushes past her up the stairs, disappears inside.

INT. BEVERLYS STUDY - AFTERNOON

Violet stands in the middle of the room.  Sunlight streams in 
through the windows surrounding her.  Approaches Beverlys 
swivel chair, touches the back, ...slowly spins it ...sits.

             VIOLET
      August... your month. Locusts are 
      raging, Summer psalm become summer 
      wrath. Course its only August out 
      there.  In here... who knows?
        (and then)
      All right... okay. The Carriage held 
      but just Ourselves, dum-de-dum...mm, 
      best I got... Emily Dickensons all I

Produces a bottle of pills, shakes one out, takes it.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      Thats for me.  One for me.

Surveys the photos behind his desk. The girls.  Vi and Bev 
together in happier times.  Picks up the hardback Meadowlark 
Bill left.  Finds Beverlys reading glasses on the desk, puts 
them on.  Thumbs through it, finds the dedication: simply:

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      For My Violet... 

Violet smiles ruefully, takes another pill.  

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      For the girls, God love em.

Surveys the book with something bordering on disgust.  
Another pill.  Sits.  Waiting.  For what?  Shes not sure.

             BARBARA
	(OS)
      Mom?!  Foods on the table!

She takes a final look around, takes one last pill.

                                70.

INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Johnna, Karen, Steve and Mattie Fae carry in serving dishes, 
set them down on the already overladen table. Charlie pours 
himself a sweet tea.  

             KAREN
      This is lovely!  You do all this?

		JOHNNA
	Mm-hmm.

		MATTIE FAE
	Shes a wonder, this one.

Bill passes through, carries us into the living room where he 
finds Jean, still watching the movie.

             BILL
      Turn that off, its time to eat.

             JEAN
      Dont suppose I could eat in here?

             BILL
      You suppose right.

Ivy comes down the stairs, looking.

             IVY
      Did I hear Little Charles?

             CHARLIE
      He went back out to the car.

EXT. BACK YARD - AFTERNOON

Ivy steps out onto the porch.  Little Charles is by his 
fathers car, retrieving a Pyrex dish.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      Moms casserole.

Shuts the door, rests the casserole on the hood.

             IVY
      They said you overslept.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      Maybe I purposely accidentally 
      overslept.  I dont know.  Im sorry.

             IVY
      Please.

                                71.


             LITTLE CHARLES
      I know you had one of the worst days 
      of your life and Im sorry if I --

             IVY
      We dont have to do that with each 
      other.

She embraces him, kisses him. He looks toward the house.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      Youre breaking our rule.

             IVY
      Theyre on to me. Not us, just me.    
      I told them I was seeing someone. I 
      didnt tell them who. I just wanted 
      you to know, in case it came up.
        (he stares at her)
      What? 
        (beat)
      Charles...

             LITTLE CHARLES
      I adore you.

INT. DINING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Barbara, Bill, Mattie Fae, Charlie, Karen, and Steve are 
already seated.  The men have removed their suit coats.  

             CHARLIE
      Pass the casserole, please?

             MATTIE FAE
      My casseroles coming.

             CHARLIE
      Ill eat some of yours, too --

             BARBARA
        (calling out)
      Mom?! Lets eat!

Little Charles and Ivy enter with the casserole.

             MATTIE FAE
      There he is. I wanted to put you at a 
      kids table but they wouldnt let me.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      Where do you want this?

                                72.


Ad-lib greetings, hugs, handshakes, Karens introduction of 
Steve. Ivy slips in and takes her seat. Little Charles goes 
to put Mattie Faes casserole on the table, but drops it.  

It lands on the floor with a sickening SPLAT.

		 LITTLE CHARLES
	(CONTD)
	Oh Jesus --!

		     MATTIE FAE
	Goddamn it --!

		BILL
	Whoops.

		STEVE
	O-pah!

             MATTIE FAE
      You goddamn clumsy goofball!

	    LITTLE CHARLES
	Mom, Im so sorry --

		CHARLIE
	All right, nobodys hurt.

Little Charles helps Johnna clean up the mess.

             MATTIE FAE
	(CONTD)
      What about me?  Im hurt.

	      CHARLIE
	Youre not hurt.

		LITTLE CHARLES
	Mom, Jesus, Im sorry --

             IVY
      Its just an accident.

             MATTIE FAE
      Thats my casserole!

	      CHARLIE
	Let it go, Mattie Fae.

		STEVE
	Its not a party until 
        someone spills something.

             CHARLIE
      Jean, you didnt get any chicken.

	      BARBARA
	No, she wont --

	      CHARLIE
	You dont eat meat.

		JEAN
	I dont eat meat.

		STEVE
	Good for you.

             CHARLIE
	(CONTD)
      Dont eat meat.  Okay.  Who wants 
      chicken?  Little Charles, chicken?

             MATTIE FAE
      Just put it on his plate for him or 
      hes liable to burn the house down.

                                73.


             CHARLIE
      All right, Mattie Fae.

             BARBARA
      Mom...!

Violet enters with a small framed photo of her and Bev.

             VIOLET
      Barb... will you put this?

             BARBARA
      Yeah, sure.

Barbara takes it, places it on the sideboard.

	     MATTIE FAE
	Thats nice.

		KAREN
	Thats sweet.

             VIOLET
      I see you gentlemen have stripped  
      down to your shirt fronts. I thought 
      we were having a funeral dinner, not  
      a cockfight.

An awkward beat. The men glumly put their suit coats back on.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      Someone should probably say grace.
        (no response)
      Barbara?

             BARBARA
      Uncle Charlie should say it.  Hes  
      the patriarch around here now.

             CHARLIE
      I am?  Oh, I guess I am.

             VIOLET
      By default.

             CHARLIE
      Okay.
        (clears his throat)
      Dear Lord...

All bow their heads.

             CHARLIE
	(CONTD)
      We ask that you watch over this family 
      in this sad time, O Lord... 

                                74.


             CHARLIE
	(CONTD)
      that you bless this good woman and 
      keep her in your, in your... grace.

A cell phone RINGS, playing the theme from Sanford and Son.  
Steve digs through his pockets, finds the phone, checks it.

             STEVE
      I have to take this.

Steve hustles into the kitchen to talk on the phone.

             CHARLIE
      We ask that you watch over Beverly, 
      too, as he, as he... as he... makes 
      his journey.  We thank thee, O Lord, 
      that we are able to join together to 
      pay tribute to this fine man, in his 
      house, with his beautiful daughters.  
      We are truly blessed in our, our 
      fellowship, our togetherness, our... 
      our fellowship.  Thank thee for the 
      food, O Lord, that we can share this 
      food and replenish our bodies with... 
      nutrients.  We ask that you help us... 
      get better.  Be better people.

Steve reenters from the kitchen, snapping his phone shut.

             CHARLIE
	(CONTD)
      We recognize now more than ever the 
      power, the... joy of family.  We ask   
      that you bless and watch over this 
      family.  Amen.

             STEVE
      Amen.  Sorry folks.

             BILL
      Lets eat.

They begin to eat.  Everyone but Violet, who smokes instead.

             VIOLET
      Barb, have any use for that sideboard?

             BARBARA
      Hm?

             VIOLET
      That sideboard there, you have any 
      interest in that?

                                75.


             BARBARA
      This?  Well... no.  I mean, why?

             VIOLET
      Im getting rid of a lot of this  
      stuff and I thought you might want 
      that sideboard.

             BARBARA
      No, Mom, I... I wouldnt have any   
      way to get that home to Colorado.

             KAREN
      Really pretty.

             VIOLET
      Mm.  Maybe Ivyll take it.

             IVY
      I have something like that, remember --

             VIOLET
      Clearing all this out of here.  I  
      want to have a brand new everything.

             BARBARA
      I.  I guess Im just sort of... not 
      prepared to talk about your stuff.

             VIOLET
      Suit yourself.

             STEVE
      This food is just spectacular.

	       KAREN
	Its so good --

		LITTLE CHARLES
	Yes, it is --

             IVY
      You like your food, Mom?

             VIOLET
      I havent tried much of it, yet --

             BARBARA
      Johnna cooked this whole meal by 
      herself.

             VIOLET
      S what shes paid for.

A silent moment.

                                76.


             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      Yall did know shes getting paid, 
      right?

             CHARLIE
      Jean, so Im curious, when you say  
      you dont eat meat, you mean you  
      dont eat meat of any kind?

             JEAN
      Right. 

             CHARLIE
      And is that for health reasons, or...?

             JEAN
      When you eat meat, you ingest an  
      animals fear.

             VIOLET
      Ingest what? Its fur?

             JEAN
      Fear.

             VIOLET
      I thought she said --

             CHARLIE
      How do you do that? You cant eat 
      fear.

             JEAN
      Sure you can. What happens to you, 
      when you feel afraid?  Doesnt your 
      body produce all sorts of chemical 
      reactions?

             CHARLIE
      Does it?

	    LITTLE CHARLES
	It does.

		IVY
	Yes.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      Adrenaline, and, and --

             JEAN
      Your body goes through a whole 
      chemical process when it    
      experiences fear.

                                77.


             LITTLE CHARLES
      -- yep, and cortisol --

             JEAN
      Dont you think an animal   
      experiences fear?

             STEVE
      You bet it does. I used to work in    
      a cattle processing plant, lot of  
      fear flying around that place.

             JEAN
      So when you eat an animal, youre 
      eating all that fear it felt when    
      it was slaughtered to make food.

             CHARLIE
      Wow. You mean Ive been eating fear, 
      what, three times a day for sixty 
      years?

             MATTIE FAE
      This one wont have a meal less 
      theres meat in it.

             CHARLIE
      I guess its the way I was raised,  
      but it just doesnt seem like a 
      legitimate meal less it has some  
      meat somewhere --

             MATTIE FAE
      If I make a pasta dish of some kind, 
      hell be like, Okay, thats good for 
      an appetizer, now wheres the meat?

             VIOLET
      Wheres the meat?  Isnt that some 
      TV commercial, the old lady says, 
      Wheres the meat?

             KAREN
      Beef, Wheres the beef?

             VIOLET
        (screeching)
      Wheres the meat?! Wheres the 
      meat?! Wheres the meat?!

             BARBARA
      Thats pleasant.

                                78.


             CHARLIE
      I thought the services were lovely.

	       KAREN
	Yes, werent they --?

		STEVE
	Preacher did a fine job.

Vi sticks her hand out, flat, wiggles it back and forth.

             VIOLET
      Ehhhhh!  I give it a...
        (repeats gesture)
      Ehhhhh!

	       KAREN
	Really?  I thought it was --

		BARBARA
	Great, now we get some 
        dramatic criticism.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      Too much talk about poetry, teaching. 
      He hadnt written any poetry to speak 
      of since 65 and he never liked 
      teaching worth a damn.  Nobody talked 
      about the good stuff.  Man was a world-
      class alcoholic, moren fifty years. 
      Nobody told the story about that night 
      he got wrangled into giving a talk at 
      that TU alumni dinner...
        (laughs)
      Drank a whole bottle of Ron Bocoy 
      White Rum -- dont know why I remember 
      that -- and got up to give this talk, 
      and he fouled himself! Comes back to 
      our table with this huge --

             BARBARA
      Yeah, I cant imagine why no one told 
      that story.

             STEVE
      I dont know much about poetry, but I 
      thought his poems were extraordinary.
        (to Bill)
      And your reading was very fine.

             BILL
      Thank you.

             VIOLET
        (to Steve)
      Who are you?

                                79.


             KAREN
      Mom, this is my fiance, Steve, I 
      introduced you at the church.

             STEVE
      Steve Heidebrecht.

             VIOLET
      Hide-the-what?

             STEVE
      Heidebrecht.

             VIOLET
      Hide-a-burrr...German, youre a 
      German.

             STEVE
      Well, German-Irish, really, I --

             VIOLET
      Thats peculiar, Karen, to bring a 
      date to your fathers funeral.  I  
      know the poetry was good, but I 
      wouldnt have really considered it 
      date material --

             BARBARA
      Jesus.

             KAREN
      Hes not a date, hes my fiance.  
      Were getting married on New Years.  
      In Miami, I hope you can make it.

             VIOLET
      I dont really see that happening, do 
      you?  Steve.  That right?  Steve?

             STEVE
      Yes, maam.

             VIOLET
      You ever been married before?

             KAREN
      Thats personal.

             STEVE
      I dont mind.  Yes, maam, I have.

             VIOLET
      Moren once?

                                80.


             STEVE
      Three times, actually, three times  
      before this --

             VIOLET
      You should pretty much have it down  
      by now, then.

             STEVE
        (laughs)
      Right, right --

Everybodys eating, passing food. Vi turns to Mattie Fae.

             VIOLET
      I had that one pegged.  I mean,    
      look at him, you can tell hes     
      been married.

             KAREN
      I took Steve out to show him the    
      old fort and its gone!

	        IVY
	Thats been gone for years.

		KAREN
	That made me so sad!

             BILL
      What is this now?

             KAREN
      Our old fort, where we used to play 
      Cowboys and Indians.

             IVY
      Daddy said rats were getting in there.

             VIOLET
      Karen!  Shame on you!  Dont you know 
      not to say Cowboys and Indians?  You 
      played Cowboys and Native Americans, 
      right Barb?

             BARBARA
      What did you take?  What pills?

             VIOLET
      Lemme alone --

Charlies silverware clatters to the floor.  He appears to be 
having some kind of attack.

             CHARLIE
      Uh-oh!


                                81.


             MATTIE FAE
      What is it?

             CHARLIE
      UH-OH!

             MATTIE FAE
      Whats the matter?

		LITTLE CHARLES
	Dad --?

		IVY
	You okay, Uncle --

             CHARLIE
      I got a big bite of fear! Im   
      shakin in my boots! Fear never  
      tasted so good. 

Laughter.  Charlie digs into his plate ravenously.

             STEVE
      Right, right, its pretty good     
      once you get used to the taste.

             BARBARA
      I catch her eating a cheeseburger 
      every now and again.

             JEAN
      I do not!

             BARBARA
      Double cheeseburger, bacon, extra 
      fear.

             JEAN
      Mom, you are such a liar!

More laughter. Violet stares at Jean.

             VIOLET
      Yknow...if I ever called my mom      
      a liar? She wouldve knocked my   
      goddamn head off my shoulders.

Silence.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      You girls know theres a will.

             BARBARA
      Mom...

                                82.


             VIOLET
      We took care of it some time back.

             BARBARA
      Mom, we dont want to talk about this.

             VIOLET
      I want to talk about it. What about 
      what I want to talk about, that count 
      for anything?
        (beat)
      Bev made some good investments, 
      believe it or not, and we had money 
      for you girls in his will, but we 
      talked it over after some years passed 
      and decided to change things, leave 
      everything to me.  We never got  
      around to taking care of it legally, 
      but you should know he meant to   
      leave the money to me.

             BARBARA
      Okay.

             VIOLET
      Okay?
        (looks to Ivy, Karen)
      Okay?

             IVY
      Okay.

             VIOLET
      Karen?  Okay?

Uncertain, Karen looks to Steve, then Barbara.

             BARBARA
      Okay.

             KAREN
      Okay.

             VIOLET
      Okay.  But now some of this furniture, 
      some of this old shit you can just 
      have.  I dont want it, got no use for 
      it.  Maybe I should have an auction.

             MATTIE FAE
      Sure, an auctions a fine idea --

                                83.


             VIOLET
      Some things, though, like the silver, 
      thats worth a pretty penny.  But if 
      you like Ill sell it to you, 
      cheapern I might get in an auction.

             BARBARA
      Or you might never get around to    
      the auction and then we can just    
      have it for free after you die.

             IVY
      Barbara...

Beat.  Violet coolly studies Barbara.

             VIOLET
      You might at that.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      Excuse me, Bill? Im wondering,     
      the reading you did, those poems --?

             VIOLET
      Where are you living now, Bill?     
      You want this old sideboard?

             BILL
      I beg your pardon.

             VIOLET
      You and Barbara are separated,   
      right?  Or you divorced already?

             BILL
      ...Were separated.

             VIOLET
        (to Barbara)
      Thought you could slip that one      
      by me, didnt you?

             BARBARA
      What is the matter with you?

             VIOLET
      Nobody slips anything by me.  I know 
      whats what.  Your father thought  
      hes slipping one by me, right?  No 
      way.  Im sorry you twore having 
      trouble, maybe you can work it out.  
      Bevn I separated a few times, course 
      we didnt call it that.

                                84.


             BARBARA
      Help us to benefit from an 
      illustration of your storybook 
      marriage.

             VIOLET
      Truth is, you cant compete with a 
      younger woman.  One of those unfair 
      things in life.  Is there a younger 
      woman involved?

             BARBARA
      Youve said enough on this topic,     
      I think.

             BILL
      Yes.  Theres a younger woman.

             VIOLET
      Ysee?  Oddsre against you there, 
      babe.

             IVY
      Mom believes women dont grow      
      more attractive with age.

             KAREN
      Oh, I disagree, I --

             VIOLET
      I didnt say they dont grow more 
      attractive, I said they get ugly.  
      And its not really a matter of 
      opinion, Karen dear.  Youve only  
      just started to prove it yourself.

             CHARLIE
      Youre in rare form today, Vi.

             VIOLET
      The day calls for it, doesnt it?  
      What form would you have me in?

             CHARLIE
      I just dont understand why youre   
      so adversarial.

             VIOLET
      Im just truth-telling.
        (to Barbara)
      Some people get antagonized by      
      the truth.

                                85.


             CHARLIE
      Everyone here loves you, dear.

             VIOLET
      You think you can shame me, Charlie?  
      Blow it out your ass.

             BARBARA
      Three days ago... I had to identify  
      my fathers corpse.  Now Im supposed 
      to sit here and listen to you 
      viciously attack each and every member 
      of this family --

Violet rises, her voice booming.

             VIOLET
      Attack my family?!  You ever been 
      attacked in your sweet spoiled life?!  
      Tell her bout attacks, Mattie Fae, 
      tell her what an attack looks like!

	     MATTIE FAE
	Vi, please --

		IVY
	Settle down, Mom --

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      Stop telling me to settle down, goddam 
      it!  Im not a goddamn invalid!  I 
      dont need to be abided, do I?!  Am   
      I already passed over?!

             MATTIE FAE
      Honey --

             VIOLET
        (points to Mattie Fae)
      This woman came to my rescue when   
      one of my dear mothers many gentlemen 
      friends was attacking me, with a claw 
      hammer!  You think you been attacked?!  
      What do you know about life on these 
      Plains?  What do you know about hard 
      times?

             BARBARA
      I know you had a rotten childhood, 
      Mom.  Who didnt?

             VIOLET
      You DONT know! You do NOT know! None 
      of you know, cept this woman right 
      here and that man we buried today! 

                                86.


             VIOLET
	(CONT'D)
      Sweet girl, sweet Barbara, my heart 
      breaks for every time you ever felt 
      pain.  I wish I coulda shielded you 
      from it.  But if you think for a 
      solitary second you can fathom the 
      pain that man endured in his natural 
      life, you got another think coming.  
      Do you know where your father lived 
      from age four till about ten?  Do you?

No one responds. 

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      Do you?!

             BARBARA
      No.

             IVY
      No.

             VIOLET
      In a Pontiac Sedan.  With his mother, 
      his father, in a fucking car!  Now  
      what do you want to say about your 
      rotten childhood?  Thats the crux of 
      the biscuit: we lived too hard, then 
      rose too high.  We sacrificed 
      everything and we did it all for you.  
      Your father and I were the first in 
      our families to finish high school  
      and he wound up an award-winning poet.  
      You girls, given a college education, 
      taken for granted no doubt, and 
      whered you wind up?
        (jabs a finger at Karen)
      Whadda you do?
        (jabs a finger at Ivy)
      Whadda you do?
        (jabs a finger at Barbara)
      Whore you?  Jesus, you worked as  
      hard as us, youd all be President.  
      You never had real problems so you got 
      to make all your problems yourselves.

             BARBARA
      Why are you screaming at us?

             VIOLET
      Just time we had some truths told 
      round here.  Damn fine day, tell    
      the truth.

                                87.


Theres a long pause as everyone gathers themselves, then:

             CHARLIE
      Well, the truth is... Im getting 
      full.

             STEVE
      Amen.

             JOHNNA
      Theres dessert, too.

             KAREN
      I saw her making those pies.       
      They looked so good.

Little Charles suddenly stands. 

             LITTLE CHARLES
      I have a truth to tell.

             VIOLET
      It speaks.

             IVY
        (softly pleading )
      No, no --

             CHARLIE
      What is it, son?

             LITTLE CHARLES
      I have a truth.

             MATTIE FAE
      Little Charles...?

             LITTLE CHARLES
      I...

             IVY
      Charles, not like this, please...

             LITTLE CHARLES
      The truth is...I forgot to set the 
      clock.  The power didnt go out, I 
      just...forgot to set the clock.  
      Sorry, Mom.  Im sorry, everyone.  
      Excuse me...I...I.

He stumbles from the room. A long moment, then --

                                88.


             VIOLET
      Scintillating.

             MATTIE FAE
        (to Charlie)
      I gave up a long time ago... Little 
      Charles is your project.

             IVY
        (near tears)
      Charles.  His name is Charles.

             VIOLET
      Poor Ivy.  Poor thing.

             IVY
      Please, Mom...

             VIOLET
      Poor baby.

             IVY
      Please...

             VIOLET
      She always had a feeling for the 
      underdog.

             IVY
      Dont be mean to me right now, okay?

             VIOLET
      Everyones got this idea Im mean   
      all of a sudden.

             IVY
      Please, momma.

             VIOLET
      I told you, Im just telling the --

             BARBARA
      Youre a drug addict. 

             VIOLET
      That is the truth!  Thats what Im 
      getting at!  I, everybody listen... I 
      am a drug addict.  I am addicted to 
      drugs, pills, specially downers.

She pulls a bottle from her pocket, holds them up.


                                89.


             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      Ysee these little blue babies?  These 
      are my best fucking friends and they 
      never let me down.  Try to get em 
      away from me and Ill eat you alive.

Barbara lunges at the bottle, she and Vi wrestle for it.

             BARBARA
      Gimme those goddamn pills --

             VIOLET
      Ill eat you alive, girl!

Bill and Ivy try to restrain Barbara; Mattie Fae tries to 
restrain Violet.  Others rise, ad-lib.  Pandemonium.

	       STEVE
	Holy shit --

	      CHARLIE
	Hey, now, cmon --!

		IVY
	Barbara, stop it --!

		KAREN
	Oh God --


Violet wrests the pills from Barb.  Bill pulls Barb back into 
her seat.  Violet shakes the bottle, taunting Barb.  Barb 
lunges again, grabs her mother by the hair, toppling chairs, 
they crash into the --


INT. LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON


Tumble to the floor.  Pandemonium, screaming.  The family 
rushes after them into the living room.  Barb has her mother 
pinned on the floor and is strangling her.  Bill and Charlie 
struggle to pull Barbara off, pry her fingers off Violets 
throat and get her away. 

Johnna and Mattie Fae rush to Violet, get her to a chair.

             VIOLET
      Goddamn you... goddamn you, Barb...

             BARBARA
      Shut up!
        (silence)
      Okay.  Pill raid.  Johnna, help Ivy    
      in the kitchen; Bill and Jean  
      upstairs with me.
        (to Ivy)
      You remember how to do this, right?

             IVY
      Yeah...


                              90.


             BARBARA
      Go through everything.  Every closet, 
      every drawer, every shoebox.

             CHARLIE
      What should we do?

             BARBARA
      Get Mom some black coffee, a wet  
      towel and listen to her bullshit. 
      Karen, call Dr. Burke.

             VIOLET
      You cant do this!  This is my   
      house!  This is my house!

             BARBARA
      You dont get it, do you?

She strides to her mother, looms over her.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      IM RUNNING THINGS NOW!

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON


The hallway is empty, but we hear the sounds of the search 
coming from the bedroom.  Barbara appears, looks through the 
linen closet, looking behind stacked towels and old electric 
blankets.  Finds a bottle of pills in the back. 

Ivy comes upstairs, followed closely by Karen.  Hold out pill  *
bottles, Barb adds them to the ones shes already collected 
in a large Ziplock bag.

             IVY
      Thats all we could find.

Barb heads for the bathroom, lifts the toilet seat.  Begins 
dumping pills into the bowl.  Karen examines the bottles. 

             KAREN
      Whyd Dr. Burke write her so many 
      prescriptions? Doesnt he know --? 

             IVY
      Its not just him.  Shes got a doctor 
      in every port. 

                               91.


             BARBARA
      You knew this was going on again?

Ivy shrugs. Finished emptying the pills, Barb flushes the 
toilet, steps to her mothers open bedroom door, looks in.

INT. VIOLETS BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Violet lays motionless on the bed in the semi-darkness, 
facing the wall, still fully clothed. Ivy and Karen join her.  
They stare at their mothers comatose form.  Finally:

             KAREN
      Now what?

             BARBARA
      Wine... lots of wine.

EXT. WESTON HOUSE YARD/GAZEBO - NIGHT

Barbara, Ivy, Karen and the remains of the dinner wine sit 
around the table in the backyard gazebo.

             BARBARA
      Think we can goad Mom into giving 
      Burke her greatest generation  
      speech tomorrow, tell him about the 
      claw hammer?

                             92.


             IVY
      Wont do any good, hes part of the 
      same generation.

             BARBARA
      Greatest Generation, my ass. What 
      makes them so great?  Because they 
      were poor and hated Nazis?  Who 
      doesnt fucking hate Nazis?  Remember 
      when we checked her in the psych ward, 
      that stunt she pulled?

             IVY
      Big speech, shes getting clean, 
      making this incredible sacrifice for 
      her family, shes let us down but now 
      shell prove shes a good mother.

             KAREN
      I wasnt there.

             BARBARA
      She smuggled Darvocet into the psych 
      ward ...in her vagina.  Theres your 
      Greatest Generation for you.  She   
      made this speech to us while she was 
      clenching a bottle of pills in her 
      cooch, for Gods sake.

             KAREN
      God, Ive never heard this story.

                             93.


             IVY
      Did you just say cooch? 

             BARBARA
      The phrase Moms pussy seems gauche. 

             IVY
      Youre a little more comfortable with 
      cooch, are you?

             BARBARA
      What word should I use to describe 
      our mothers vagina?

             IVY
      I dont know, but --

             BARBARA
      Moms beaver?  Mothers box?

	        IVY
	Oh God --

		KAREN
	Barbara!


As their laughter slowly dies down --

             KAREN
      One thing about Mom and Dad. You have 
      to tip your cap to anyone who can stay 
      married that long.

             IVY
      Karen.  He killed himself.

             BARBARA
      Is there something going on between 
      you and Little Charles?

             IVY
      I dont know that Im comfortable 
      talking about that.

                              93A.


             BARBARA
      Because you know hes our first 
      cousin.

             IVY
      Give me a break.

             KAREN
      You know you shouldnt consider 
      children.

             IVY
      I cant anyway, I had a hysterectomy 
      last year.

What? Barbara and Karen stare at Ivy.

                              94.


             KAREN
      Why?

             IVY
      Cervical cancer.

             KAREN
      I didnt know.

             BARBARA
      Neither did I.

             IVY
      I didnt tell anyone except Charles.  
      Thats where it started between us.

             BARBARA
      Why not?

             IVY
      And hear it from Mom the rest of my 
      life? She doesnt need another excuse 
      to treat me like some damaged thing.

             BARBARA
      You might have told us. 

             IVY
      You didnt tell us about you and Bill.

             BARBARA
      Thats different.

             IVY
      Why?  Because its you, and not me?

             BARBARA
      Because divorce is an embarrassing 
      public admission of defeat.  Cancers 
      fucking cancer, you cant help that.  
      Were your sisters.

             IVY
      I dont feel that connection very 
      keenly.

             KAREN
      I feel very connected, to both of you.

             IVY
      We never see you, youre never around, 
      you havent been around --

                              95.


             KAREN
      I still feel that connection!

             IVY
      I cant perpetuate these myths of 
      family or sisterhood anymore.  Were 
      just people, some of us accidentally 
      connected by genetics, a random 
      selection of cells.

             BARBARA
      When did you get so cynical?

             IVY
      Thats funny, coming from you.

             BARBARA
      Bitter, sure, but random selection 
      of cells?

             IVY
      Maybe my cynicism came with the 
      realization that the responsibility of 
      caring for our parents was mine alone.

             BARBARA
      Dont give me that. I participated --

             IVY
      Till you had enough and got out,    
      you and Karen both.  Im not 
      criticizing.  Do what you want. You 
      did, Karen did.

             BARBARA
      And if you didnt, thats not my 
      fault.

             IVY
      Thats right, so dont lay this sister 
      thing on me, all right? When I leave 
      here I wont feel any more guilty than 
      you two did.

             KAREN
      I cant believe your world view is 
      this dark.

             IVY
      You live in Florida.

                              96.


             BARBARA
      Youre thinking of leaving?

             IVY
      Charles and I are going to New York.

Barb bursts out in derisive laughter.  Karen joins her.  

             BARBARA
      What are you going to do in New York?

             IVY
      We have plans.

             BARBARA
      Like what?

             IVY
      None of your business.

             BARBARA
      What about Mom?

             IVY
      What about her?

             BARBARA
      You feel comfortable leaving Mom here?

             IVY
      Do you?
        (then)
      You think she was tough when he was 
      alive?  Think what its going to be 
      like now. 
        (to Karen)
     Youre going back to Miami, right?

             KAREN
     Yes.

Ivy stands, gathers up her wine glass. 

                              98.


             IVY
      There you go, Barb.  You want to know 
      what were doing about Mom?  Karen and 
      I are leaving.  You want to stay, 
      thats your decision.  But nobody gets 
      to point a finger at me.  Nobody.

Ivy starts back for the house.

EXT. WESTON HOUSE YARD - NIGHT

The Weston women head for the house.  

             VIOLET
      My girls all together.  Hearing you 
      just now gave me a warm feeling.

Violet, sits on the swing in the semi-darkness, smoking, her 
hair wrapped in a towel.  They hadnt seen her.  How long has
she been there?


                              99.


             BARBARA
      You had a bath?

             VIOLET
      Uh-huh...

             BARBARA
      You need something to eat?  More 
      coffee?

             VIOLET
      No, honey, Im fine. 
        (then)
      This house must have heard a lot of 
      Weston girl secrets. 

Karen moves to her mother, sits next to her on the swing. 
Barb leans against a fence post, Ivy hangs back.

             KAREN
      I get embarrassed just thinking   
      about it.

Karen takes a tube of hand creme from her purse.

             VIOLET
      Oh... nothing to be embarrassed 
      about.  Secret crushes, secret 
      schemes.  Province of teenage girls.  
      I cant imagine anything more 
      delicate, or bittersweet.  Some part 
      of you girls I always identified 
      with... no matter how old you get, a 
      womans hard-pressed to throw off 
      that part of herself.
        (to Karen, re: hand creme)
      That smells good.

             KAREN
      Its apple.  You want some?

             VIOLET
      Yes, please.

Violet puts out her cigarette. Karen passes her the creme.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      I ever tell you the story of Raymond 
      Qualls?  Not much story to it.  Boy I 
      had a crush on when I was thirteen or 
      so.  Rough-looking boy, beat-up Levis, 
      messy hair.  Terrible underbite.  

                                100.


             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      But he had these beautiful cowboy 
      boots, shiny chocolate leather.  He 
      was so proud of those boots, you could 
      tell, way hed strut around, all arms 
      and elbows, puffed up and cocksure.  I 
      decided I needed to get a girly pair 
      of those same boots and I convinced 
      myself hed ask me to go steady.  Hed 
      see me in those boots and say Now 
      theres the gal for me.  

Violet lights another cigarette.


             VIOLET
	(CONT'D)
      Found the boots in a window downtown 
      and just went crazy: praying for those 
      boots, rehearsing the conversation Id 
      have with Raymond when he saw me in my 
      boots. Mustve asked my momma a 
      hundred times if I could get those 
      boots.  What do you want for 
      Christmas, Vi?  Momma, Ill give all 
      of it up just for those boots.  
      Bargaining, you know?  She started 
      dropping hints about a package under 
      the tree she had wrapped up, about the 
      size of a boot box, nice wrapping 
      paper.  Now, Vi, dont you cheat and 
      look in there before Christmas 
      morning.  Little smile on her face.  
      Christmas morning, I was up like a 
      shot, boy, under the tree, tearing 
      open that box.  There was a pair of 
      boots, all right... mens work boots, 
      holes in the toes, chewed up laces, 
      caked in mud and dog shit.  Lord, my 
      momma laughed for days.

             BARBARA
      Please dont tell me thats the end of 
      the story.

             VIOLET
      Oh, no.  Thats the end.

Silence.

Ivy shakes her head, goes inside. Shes had enough of Violet 
to last a lifetime.  

             KAREN
      You never got the boots?

                              101.


             VIOLET
      No, huh-uh.

             BARBARA
      Okay, well, thats the worst story I 
      ever heard.  That makes me wish for a 
      heartwarming claw hammer story.

             VIOLET
      My momma was a nasty-mean old lady.  I 
      suppose thats where I get it from. 

An awkward moment.

             KAREN
      Youre not nasty-mean. Youre our 
      mother and we love you.

             VIOLET
      Thank you, sweetheart.

Karen leans her head against her mothers shoulder, takes her 
mothers hand.  Off Barbara, watching this --


INT. GUEST ROOM - EARLY MORNING

Barbara wakes, takes a moment to get her bearings.  Early 
sunlight pours in.  Bills still asleep.  She sits up, 
studies him.  Surprised to find him beside her.  


                              102.
INT/EXT. BACKYARD - EARLY MORNING

Barbara stands in the door.  Closes her eyes, letting the 
early morning sun warm her.  After a long moment, Johnna 
appears with a coffee mug.  Barb takes it, nods her thanks.

             BARBARA
      Last time I spoke with my father, we 
      talked about the state of the world, 
      and he said, You know, this country 
      was always pretty much a whorehouse, 
      but at least it used to have some 
      promise.  Now its just a shithole.  
      I think maybe he was talking about 
      something else, something more 
      specific, personal... this house? This 
      family?  His marriage?  Himself?  
      There was something sad in his voice-- 
      not sad, he always sounded sad --
      hopeless. As if it had already 
      happened.  As if whatever was 
      disappearing had already disappeared.  
      And no one saw it go.  This country, 
      this experiment, America, this hubris: 
      what a lament, if no one saw it go.

             JOHNNA
      Mrs. Fordham, are you going to     
      fire me?

             BARBARA
      What?  No.  But Ill understand if  
      you want to quit.  I mean, theres 
      work.  And then theres work.  

             JOHNNA
      Im familiar with this job. I can    
      do this job.  I dont do it for you   
      or Mrs. Weston.  Or even for Mr. 
      Weston.  Right?  I do it for me.

             BARBARA
      Why?

             JOHNNA
      I need the work.

             BARBARA
      Johnna, did my father say anything to 
      you?

                                103.


             JOHNNA
      He just seemed like maybe he had... he 
      talked about...
        (beat)
      He talked a lot about his daughters, 
      his three daughters, and his 
      granddaughter.  That was his joy.

             BARBARA
      Thank you.  That makes me feel better. 
      Knowing that you can lie.

Johnna smiles.

INT. DOCTORS OFFICE/WAITING ROOM - DAY

Barbara sits opposite DR. BURKE, a genial, charming and 
remotely creepy small town doctor. Ivy stands.  Violet is 
visible out in the waiting room, Karen sitting with her.  

             DR. BURKE
      The chemotherapy and the radiation, 
      coupled with the overuse of pain 
      medications --

             BARBARA
      -- right --

             DR. BURKE
      -- and without the benefit of more 
      thorough testing, an MRI or CT scan, I 
      believe your mother is showing signs 
      of Mild Cognitive Impairment.

             BARBARA
      Mild Cognitive Impairment?

             DR. BURKE
      Brain damage.  It may be time to 
      consider placing her in a long term 
      care facility.  Id certainly feel 
      more comfortable knowing she was 
      receiving that level of supervision.

             BARBARA
      That would make you comfortable?  You 
      would be comfortable with that?

             DR. BURKE
      Of course, its a family decision.

                                104.


             BARBARA
      You want us to send her to where, a 
      psychiatric hospital?

             DR. BURKE
      Well, Beverlys gone.

             BARBARA
      Right.  Not gone so much as dead, 
      but I see your point.

Ivy suppresses a laugh.  Burke looks at Ivy, confused.

             DR. BURKE
      Legal guardianship for you and your 
      sisters, with my recommendation, 
      should be a simple --

             IVY
      Leave me out of this, thanks.

             BARBARA
      So youre thinking that if the    
      three of us cooperated with you on     
      a commitment end-around, wed be    
      less likely to sue your ass?

             DR. BURKE
      Im sorry?

             BARBARA
      Mild Cognitive Impairment?  Are you 
      fucking kidding me?  You really want 
      to go before a judge and make a case 
      for a couple radiation treatments and 
      some chemo causing brain damage?  
      Think you can make that stand up in 
      court?  When Im sitting at the other 
      table, doing this?

Barbara pulls out the Ziplock bag, throws a pill bottle at 
Dr. Burke, bouncing it lightly off his head. 

             DR. BURKE
      All right, I think --

Throws another pill bottle at him.

             BARBARA
      Know whose name is on these bottles?

She hits him with another pill bottle.

                                105.


             DR. BURKE
      Your mother is a very --

She hits him with another pill bottle.

             IVY
      Barb...

She hits him with another pill bottle.  He relents, waits for 
her to get it out of her system.  Only one problem with that 
idea, though --

She hits him with another pill bottle.

Another pill bottle. And another pill bottle.

She pauses.  It seems shes done.

But then, another pill bottle.  And another.

             BARBARA
      Well hang on to the bucket of these 
      we have at home.  For evidence.  For 
      your trial.  

She gets up to go, gets to the door, turns and fires one last 
pill bottle at him.  Leaves.  Ivy lingers, grins at Burke. 

INT/EXT. TALLGRASS PRAIRIE PRESERVE/BEVS LINCOLN - DAY

The sun parched Indian grass and Turkey Toot are wilting but 
stirred by prairie winds.  Bevs old Lincoln follows a thread 
of blacktop through the tall grass.  Barb drives, Ivy up 
front.  Karens in the back with Violet.

             VIOLET
      Pull the car over.

             BARBARA
      Well be home in a few minutes.

             VIOLET
      Pull the car over.
        (beat)
      Im going to be sick.

Barbara looks back, sees her mother means this literally, 
pulls to the side of the road.  Violet gets out quickly.

We stay with Barbara as she climbs out of the car, stares 
across the road, waiting for Violet, who can be heard 
retching.  Karen and Ivy still in the car.

                                106.


The sound fades as Barbara contemplates the prairie and for a 
long moment... loses herself, back to this land, to her home.  
Her expression is unreadable, enigmatic. 

Then behind her, out of focus, we become aware of Violet 
running away, across the prairie, through the tall grass.

Barbara turns, simply to get back in the car, sees Violet 
running through the field.

             BARBARA
      Mom?

Violet keeps running.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      Mom?!  Where are you going?

Barbara watches for another moment.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      Goddamn it.  Mom!

Barbara takes off after her.  Ivy and Karen climb out, but 
dont follow.  Shield their eyes to watch the chase.

Its an odd sight, the two women, racing through the grass. 
One almost seventy, the other nearing fifty.

Barbara is slow in her pursuit at first, maybe because of her 
shoes, or maybe because she just feels silly.  Then realizes 
that Violet is not stopping... not unless Barbara stops her.

Violet runs through the tall grass, puts a foot wrong, goes 
down.  Barbara catches up, out of breath, collapses.  They 
lay on the ground, wheezing, sweating.  

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      Where the fuck are you going, Mom?

And now we see the full beauty of the land, the distant  
horizon, the high cumulous clouds, the endless blue sky.  
Barb and Violet two dots, lost in the unforgiving prairie.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      Theres nowhere to go.

INT/EXT. LINCOLN/WESTON HOUSE DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON

Barb pulls the Lincoln in beside Charlies Caddie and Ivys 
Honda.  Shuts off the engine.  Ivy and Karen climb out, start 
back for the house.  Barbara turns to Violet.

                                107.


             BARBARA
      Im sorry.

             VIOLET
      Please, honey --

             BARBARA
      No, its important I say this.  I lost 
my temper at dinner and went too far. 

             VIOLET
      Barbara.  The day, the funeral... the 
      pills. I was spoiling for a fight and 
      you gave it to me.

             BARBARA
      So... truce?

             VIOLET
        (laughs)
      Truce.

They take a long moment, then --

             BARBARA
      What now?

             VIOLET
      How do you mean?

             BARBARA
      Dont you think you should at least 
      consider a rehab center?

Karen turns, realizing theyre not following.  Should she go 
back to the car?  She decides no, continues inside.

             VIOLET
      I cant go through that again.  No, I 
      can do this.  You got rid of my pills, 
      right?

             BARBARA
      All we could find.

             VIOLET
      I dont have that many hiding places.

             BARBARA
      Mom, now, come on.

             VIOLET
      You wanna search me?

                                108.


             BARBARA
      Uh... no.

             VIOLET
      If the pills are gone, Ill be fine.  
      Just need a few days to get my feet 
      under me.

             BARBARA
      I cant imagine what all this must 
      be like for you right now.  I just 
      want you to know, youre not alone. 
      If you need any help --

             VIOLET
      I dont need help.

             BARBARA
      I want to help.

             VIOLET
      I dont need your help.

             BARBARA
      Mom.

             VIOLET
      I dont need your help.  Ive gotten 
      myself through some... I know how this 
      goes: once all the talkings through, 
      people go back to their own nonsense. 
      I know that. So, dont worry about me.  
      Ill manage. I get by.

Violet gets out, heads inside.  Barbara watches her go.

INT. WESTON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

Ivy finds Little Charles watching television.

             IVY
      Is the coast clear?

             LITTLE CHARLES
      Never very.

Ivy waits until Karen passes through, heads upstairs.

             IVY
      What are you watching?

                                109.


             LITTLE CHARLES
      Television.

             IVY
      Can I watch it with you?

             LITTLE CHARLES
      I wish you would.

She sits beside him on the couch.

             LITTLE CHARLES
	(CONTD)
      I almost blew it last night.
        (she nods)
      Are you mad at me?

             IVY
      Nope.

They hold hands.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      I was trying to be brave.

             IVY
      I know.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      I just... I want everyone to know 
      that I got what I always wanted.    
      And that means... Im not a loser.

             IVY
      Hey.  Hey.

He turns to look at her.

             IVY
	(CONTD)
      Youre my hero.

He considers this... then breaks into a huge smile, mutes the 
TV, goes to the ancient, oak, electric piano, turns it on.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      Come on, help me push the pedal.

She joins him on the piano bench.

             LITTLE CHARLES
	(CONTD)
      I wrote this for you.

He plays, and quietly sings a gentle but quirky love song.  
Its charming, touching. 

                                110.


She smiles, he smiles back.  Midway through, Mattie Fae 
enters, watches for a moment.  Then breaks the spell.

             MATTIE FAE
      Liberace.  Get yourself together,    
      we have to get home and take care    
      of those damn dogs.  Theyve probably 
      eaten the drapes by now.

Charlie comes down the stairs with their overnight bag.

             CHARLIE
      Im sure the house is fine.

             MATTIE FAE
        (notices the TV)
      Oh, look, honey, Little Charles has 
      got the TV on.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      No, I was just --

             MATTIE FAE
      This one watches so much television, 
      its rotted his brain.  

             IVY
      Im sure thats not true.

             MATTIE FAE
      What was it I caught you watching the 
      other day?

             LITTLE CHARLES
      I dont remember.

             CHARLIE
      Mattie Fae --

             MATTIE FAE
      You do so remember, some dumb talk 
      show about people swapping wives.

             LITTLE CHARLES
      I dont remember.

             MATTIE FAE
      You dont remember. 
        (to Ivy)
      Too bad there isnt a job where they 
      pay you to sit around watching TV.

                                111.


             CHARLIE
      Cmon, Mattie Fae --

             MATTIE FAE
        (still to Ivy)
      Yknow he got fired from a shoe store?

             CHARLIE
      Mattie Fae, were gonna get in the 
      car and go home and if you say one 
      more mean thing to that boy Im going 
      to kick your fat Irish ass onto the 
      highway.  You hear me?

             MATTIE FAE
      What the hell did you say--?

             CHARLIE
      You kids go outside, would you please?

Ivy and Little Charles go.

             CHARLIE
	(CONTD)
      I dont understand this meanness.  I 
      look at you and your sister and the 
      way you talk to people and I dont 
      understand it.  I cant understand why 
      folks cant be respectful of one 
      another.  I dont think theres any 
      excuse for it.  My family didnt treat 
      each other that way.

             MATTIE FAE
      Maybe thats because your family --

             CHARLIE
      You had better not say anything about 
      my family right now.  I mean it.  We 
      buried a man yesterday I loved very 
      much.  And whatever faults he may have 
      had, he was a good, kind, decent 
      person.  And to hear you tear into 
      your own son not even a day later 
      dishonors Beverlys memory.  Weve 
      been married thirty-eight years.  I 
      wouldnt trade them for anything.  But 
      if you cant find a generous place in 
      your heart for your own son, were not 
      going to make it to thirty-nine.

He goes.  She takes a moment to collect herself, turns to 
follow, finds Barbara standing out in the open kitchen door.   *
Theres an awkward moment. 

                                112.


             BARBARA
      I didnt mean to eavesdrop.  I froze.

             MATTIE FAE
      Thats -- you have a cigarette, hon?

             BARBARA
      No, I quit years ago.  

             MATTIE FAE
      So did I.  Just sounded good to me.  
      I thought at dinner... at that 
      horrible dinner last night, seemed 
      like, something might be going on 
      between Ivy and Little Charles.  Do 
      you know if thats true?

             BARBARA
      Oh, this is...Im not sure what to...

             MATTIE FAE
      Look, just.  Is it true?

             BARBARA
      Yes.  Its true.

             MATTIE FAE
      Okay.  That cant happen.

             BARBARA
      This is going to be difficult, uh... 
      Ivy and Little Charles have always 
      marched to their own... and Id expect 
      this to be toughest on you --

             MATTIE FAE
      Barb...?

             BARBARA
      Theyre in love.  Or they think they 
      are.  Whats the difference, right?

             MATTIE FAE
      Honey --

             BARBARA
      I know its unorthodox for cousins to 
      get together, at least these days --

             MATTIE FAE
      Theyre not cousins.

                                113.


             BARBARA
      -- but believe it or not, its not as 
      uncommon as you might --

             MATTIE FAE
      Listen to me.  Theyre not cousins.

             BARBARA
      Beg pardon?

             MATTIE FAE
      Little Charles is not your cousin.  
      Hes your brother. Hes your blood 
      brother.  He is not your cousin.  He 
      is your blood brother. Half-brother. 
      Hes your fathers child.  Which 
      means that he is Ivys brother.  Do 
      you see?  Little Charles and Ivy are 
      brother and sister.

Karen and Steve enter from outside.

             BARBARA
      Go away.

             KAREN
      Were just going to --

             BARBARA
      Go away!  NOW!  GO AWAY!

Karen and Steve retreat.  Barbara stares at Mattie Fae.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      You and Dad.
        (Mattie Fae nods)
      Who knows this?

             MATTIE FAE
      I do.  And you do.

             BARBARA
      Uncle Charlie doesnt suspect?

             MATTIE FAE
      Weve never discussed it.

             BARBARA
      What?!

             MATTIE FAE
      Weve never discussed it. Okay?

                                114.


             BARBARA
      Did Dad know?

             MATTIE FAE
      Yes.  Yknow, Im not proud of this.

             BARBARA
      Really.  You people amaze me.  What, 
      were you drunk?  Was this just some -- 

             MATTIE FAE
      I wasnt drunk, no.  Maybe its hard 
      for you to believe, looking at me, 
      knowing me the way you do, all these 
      years.  I know to you, Im just your 
      old fat Aunt Mattie Fae.  Im more 
      than that, sweetheart, theres more to 
      me than that.  I dont know why Little 
      Charles is such a disappointment to 
      me.  Maybe he, well, I dont know why. 
      Im disappointed for him, more than 
      anything.  I made a mistake, a long 
      time ago.  Okay? I paid for it.  But 
      the mistake ends here.

             BARBARA
      If Ivy found out, it would destroy 
      her.

             MATTIE FAE
      Im sure as hell not gonna tell her. 
      You have to find a way to stop it.  
      You have to put a stop to it.

EXT. WESTON HOUSE BACKYARD - NIGHT

Its late, the house still.  We MOVE through dark rooms, 
drawn to the murmur of SOUND and a faint sound coming from 
outside the kitchen -- 

             JEAN
	(OS)
      You werent kidding, this stuff is 
      strong.

             STEVE
	(OS)
      Florida, baby.  Number one industry.

             JEAN
      Who cares?

                                115.


Slowly DISCOVER: Jean and Steve sharing a joint, out by the 
fence.  She wears a long T-shirt; he wears sweat pants and a 
sleeveless T-shirt.  Both are barefoot.

             STEVE
      Number one by far.  Want a shotgun?
        (off her look)
      You dont know what a shotgun is?

             JEAN
      I know what a shotgun is.

             STEVE
      Not that kind of shotgun, here.  Just 
      put your lips right next to mine and 
      you inhale while I exhale.

             JEAN
      Okay.

He puts the joint in his mouth, lit end first.  Their lips 
nearly touch as he blows marijuana smoke into her mouth in a 
steady stream.  She nearly chokes.

             STEVE
      Hold it.  Dont let it out.

She finally gasps, exhales, coughs.

             STEVE
	(CONTD)
      Thats a kick, huh?

INT. THE ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT

Johnna wakes. Listens. Sits up. 

INT. ATTIC STAIRS/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Johnna makes her way down the attic stairs and into the 
second floor hallway, the whispers below unintelligible.  

INT. MAIN STAIRCASE/HALLWAY

Johnna steps into the main hallway.  Drawn to whispers, and 
giggling from outside in the yard. 

             STEVE
	(OS)
      ...Show em to me...  I wont look.

                                116.


             JEAN
	(OS)
      If you wont look, theres no point 
      in showing them to you.

             STEVE
	(OS)
      Okay, okay...  Ill look. 

             JEAN
	(OS)
      Youre just an old perv...

             STEVE
	(OS)
      Christ, you got a great set.  Show you 
      mine if youll show me yours.

             JEAN
	(OS)
      I dont want to see yours, perv.

Johnna approaches carefully, cant yet see them.

             STEVE
	(OS)
      You ever seen one?

             JEAN
	(OS)
      What are you doing?

             STEVE
	(OS)
      Nothing.

             JEAN
	(OS)
      Youre gonna get us both in trouble.

             STEVE
	(OS)
      Im white and over thirty.  I dont 
      get in trouble.

Johnna pushes out the screen to DISCOVER: Steve kissing and 
groping Jean, sliding his hand down between her legs.

Johnna grabs a shovel leaning against the storm cellar door.  
Jean and Steve, clothes in disarray, quickly separate.

	       JEAN
	Oh my God...

		STEVE
	Ho, fuck!

Johnna approaches Steve menacingly.

             STEVE
	(CONTD)
      Hold up there, lady, you dont --

Johnna SWINGS the shovel, barely misses Steves nose.  
Bedroom lights above SNAP ON.   

                                117.


             STEVE
	(CONTD)
      Hey, goddamn it, careful!

She swings again, HARD. The shovel SMACKS into the arm he 
puts up to block her smashing his head with the spade.

             STEVE
	(CONTD)
      Ow, goddamn --!

He holds his arm in pain.  She wades in with a strong swing 
and CONNECTS with his back.  He goes down.  Johnna stands 
above him, arm cocked, watching for him to try and get up.  
He doesnt.  Karen rushes out, sees Steve on the floor. 

             KAREN
      What happened?!

             JOHNNA
      He was messing with Jean --

             KAREN
      Honey, youre bleeding, you okay?

He groans, tries to sit up.  Bill and Barbara run in. 

             BARBARA
      Jean, what are you doing up?

             JEAN
      We were, I dont know --

	      BARBARA
	Who was?  Are you alright?

		BILL
	Do I need to call a doctor?

		    JEAN
	(CONTD)
	Yeah, Im fine. 

		KAREN
	I dont know.

             BARBARA
      Johnna, whats going on?

             JOHNNA
      He was messing with Jean, so I   
      tuned him up.

	      BARBARA
	Messing with, what do you 
	mean, messing with?

		BILL
	What...whats that mean?

             JOHNNA
	(CONTD)
      He was kissing and grabbing her. 


                                118.


This information settles in... then Barbara attacks Steve, 
whos just gotten to his feet.  Karen gets between them.  
Bill grabs Barbara from behind, trying to pull her away.

             BARBARA
      Ill murder you, you prick!

             STEVE
      I didnt do anything!

	       JEAN
	Mom, stop it!

		KAREN
	Settle down --!

             BARBARA
      You know how old that girl is?

             STEVE
        (to Jean)
      Tell them I didnt do anything!

             BARBARA
      Shes fourteen years old!

	   BARBARA
	(CONTD)
	Are you out of your goddamn 
	mind?

		KAREN
	Barbara, just back off!

Karen manages to get Steve up the porch steps and into the 
house.  Barbara, Bill, Jean, and Johnna remain.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      Son-of-a-bitch is a goddamn sociopath!

             JEAN
      What is the matter with you?  Will  
      you please stop freaking out?

             BILL
      Why dont you start at the beginning?

             BARBARA
      What are you even doing up?

             BILL
      Please, sweetheart, we need to know 
      what went on here.

             JEAN
      Nothing went on.  Can we just not 
      make a federal case out of every 
      thing?  I came down for a drink, he 
      came in... end of story.  All right?

                                119.


	      BARBARA
	Thats not the end of the 
	story.

		BILL
	Thats not the end of the 
	story.

             JEAN
	(CONTD)
      We smoked pot, alright?  We smoked   
      a little pot, and we were goofing 
      around, and then everything just  
      went crazy.

      		BARBARA
	What have I told you about 
	smoking that shit?!  What did 
	I say?

		BILL
	Then Johnna just chose to 
	attack him with a shovel?  

             JEAN
	(CONTD)
      Its no big deal, nothing happened.

             BARBARA
      Just tell me what he did!

             JEAN
      He didnt do anything!  Whats the 
      big deal?

             BILL
      The big deal, Jean, is that youre 
      fourteen years old.

             JEAN
      Which is only a few years younger 
      than you like em.

Barbara SLAPS Jean; Jean bursts into tears.

             JEAN
	(CONTD)
      I hate you!

             BARBARA
      Yeah, I hate you too, you little 
      freak!

Jean tries to head into the house.  Bill grabs her.

       		BILL
	Jean--

		JEAN
	Let me go!


Jean pulls free, runs off.  Bill gets in Barbaras face.

             BILL
      Whats the matter with you?

                                120.


Bill exits, pursuing Jean.  Barbara and Johnna are left 
standing there, then:

WE FOLLOW Barb into the kitchen and up the stairs to --

INT. THE GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

Karen is pulling on a sweatshirt, grabbing their clothes, 
stuffing them into a suitcase.

             KAREN
      I can do without a speech.

             BARBARA
      Where is he?

             KAREN
      Out at the car.  Were leaving.   
      Back to Florida, tonight, now.      
      Me and Steve, together.  Want to  
      give me some grief about that?

             BARBARA
      Now wait just a goddamn --

             KAREN
      You better find out from Jean exactly 
      what went on before you start 
      pointing fingers.  Cause I doubt 
      Jeans blameless in all this.  And 
      Im not blaming her, just cause I 
      said shes not blameless doesnt mean 
      Ive blamed her.  Im saying she 
      might share in the responsibility. 
      Its not cut and dried, black and 
      white, good and bad.  It lives where 
      everything lives: somewhere in the 
      middle.  Where the rest of us live, 
      everyone but you.

             BARBARA
      Karen--

             KAREN
      Hes not perfect.  Just like the rest 
      of us, down here in the muck.  Im no 
      angel myself.  Ive done some things 
      Im not proud of.  Things youll never 
      know about.  I may even have to do 
      some things Im not proud of again. 
      Cause sometimes life puts you in a 
      corner that way.  

                                121.


             KAREN
	(CONT'D)
      And I am a human being, after all.  
      Anyway.  You have your own hash to 
      settle.  Before you start making 
      speeches to the rest of us.

             BARBARA
      Right...

             KAREN
      Come January... Ill be in Belize.  
      Doesnt that sound nice?

Karen pushes past Barb, rolling her suitcase behind her.

EXT. WESTON HOUSE AND DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

Karen bursts through the screen door, rushes down the steps 
to Steves waiting Ferrari, its lights already on, engine 
running.  Throws her suitcase in the back. 

Barb steps out onto the porch as it reverses, SLAMS into gear 
and accelerates down the drive, spewing gravel as it goes.

Bill comes out, watches it disappear with Barbara.  Then:

             BILL
      Im taking Jean with me, heading back 
      to Colorado in the morning.

But Barbs still focused on the distant Ferrari.

             BILL
	(CONTD)
      Shes too much for you right now.

             BARBARA
      Okay.

             BILL
      Im sure youll find a way to blame  
      me for all this.

             BARBARA
      Yeah, well...
        (beat)
      I cant make it up to Jean right   
      now.  Shes just going to have to  
      wait until I get back to Boulder. 

             BILL
      You and Jean have about forty years 
      left to fight and make up.

                                122.


             BARBARA
        (confused)
      Why, what happens in forty years?

             BILL
      You die.

             BARBARA
      Oh, right.

             BILL
      I mean --

             BARBARA
      No.  Right.  I fail.  As a mother,  
      as a daughter, as a wife.  I fail.

             BILL
      No, you dont.

             BARBARA
      Ive physically attacked Mom and Jean 
      in the span of twenty-four hours.  You 
      stick around here and Ill cut off 
      your penis.

             BILL
      Thats not funny.

He starts back inside. 

             BARBARA
      Youre never coming back to me, are 
      you, Bill?

             BILL
      Never say never, but...

             BARBARA
      But no.

             BILL
      But no.

             BARBARA
      Even if things dont work out with  
      you and Marsha.

             BILL
      Cindy.

             BARBARA
      Cindy.

                                123.


             BILL
      Right. Even if things dont work out.

             BARBARA
      And Im never really going to 
      understand why, am I?

Bill struggles... seems he might have more to say, but then:

             BILL
      Probably not.

Bill goes.  She watches him leave.  Fights back tears.

EXT. WESTON HOUSE - DAY

A blistering hot late August day.  The Weston house sits in 
bucolic, heat-weary silence.  The driveway no longer crowded 
with cars.  Barb stands nearly where she did the night 
before, in her sweats and robe.  Watching yet another car go. 

Their rental, Bill behind the wheel, backing up.  Jean in the 
seat beside him.  Jean stares blankly at her mother, as she 
rolls past.  Bill never looks back.  

The rental heads down the drive, passing Ivys Honda 
arriving.  Bill slows for a moment to let Ivy pass.  Then 
continues on its way back to Tulsa and the airport. 

Ivy pulls in next to Bevs big Lincoln.  Climbs out.  Walks 
to her sister, looks back to the rental leaving. 

             IVY
      Where are Bill and Jean going?

Barbara doesnt answer, just stands there.

             IVY
	(CONTD)
      Karen, too?

             BARBARA
      Yeah...

Barb turns, heads for the house, Ivy follows --

             IVY
      Is she clean?

             BARBARA
      Shes moderately clean.

                                124.


             IVY
      Moderately?

             BARBARA
      You dont like moderately?  Then lets 
      say tolerably.

             IVY
      Is she clean, or not?

             BARBARA
      Back off.

             IVY
      Im nervous.

             BARBARA
      Oh Christ, Ivy, not today.

             IVY
      I have to tell her, dont I?  Were 
      leaving for New York tomorrow.

             BARBARA
      Thats not a good idea.  For you and 
      Charles to take this any further.

             IVY
      Where is this coming from?

Barbara heads up the porch steps and into --


INT. THE WESTON HOUSE/KITCHEN - DAY

             BARBARA
      Lot of fish in the sea.  Surely you 
      can rule out the one single man in 
      the world youre related to.

             IVY
      I love the man Im related to--

             BARBARA
      Fuck love, what a crock of shit.  
      People can convince themselves they 
      love a painted rock.

They find Johnna cooking in the kitchen.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      Looks great.  What is it?

                                125.


             JOHNNA
      Catfish.

             BARBARA
      Bottom feeders, my favorite.  Youre 
      nearly fifty years old, Ivy, you cant 
      go to New York, youll break a hip.  
      Eat your catfish.

             IVY
      I have lived in this town, year in 
      and year out, hoping against hope 
      someone would come into my life--

             BARBARA
      Dont get all Carson McCullers on   
      me.  Now wipe that tragic look off 
      your face and eat some catfish.

They head into the dining room, find Violet smoking, working 
on her jigsaw puzzle.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      Howdy, Mom.

             VIOLET
      Whats howdy about it?

             BARBARA
      Look, catfish for lunch.  Johnna!
        (to Violet)
      You hungry?

             VIOLET
      Ivy, you should smile.  Like me.

Johnna enters from the kitchen.

             BARBARA
      Mom needs her lunch, please.

             VIOLET
      Im not hungry.

             BARBARA
      You havent eaten anything today.  
      You didnt eat anything yesterday.

             VIOLET
      Im not hungry.

             IVY
      Why arent either of you dressed?

                                126.


             BARBARA
      Were dressed.  Were not sitting here 
      naked, are we?

             VIOLET
      Yeah...

Johnna reenters with plates, then goes.

             BARBARA
      Eat.

             VIOLET
      No.

             BARBARA
      Eat it.  Mom?  Eat it.

             VIOLET
      No.

             BARBARA
      Eat it, you fucker.  Eat that catfish.

             VIOLET
      Go to hell.

             BARBARA
      That doesnt cut any fucking ice with 
      me.  Now eat that fucking fish.

             IVY
      Mom, I have something to talk to you--

             BARBARA
      No you dont.

             IVY
      Barbara--

             BARBARA
      No you dont.  Shut up.  Shut the fuck 
      up.

             IVY
      Please--

             VIOLET
      Whats to talk about?

             IVY
      Mom--

                                127.


             BARBARA
      Forget it.  Eat that fucking fish.

             VIOLET
      Im not hungry.

             BARBARA
      Eat it.

             VIOLET
      NO!

             IVY
      Mom, I need to--!

             VIOLET
      NO!

             IVY
      MOM!

             BARBARA
      EAT THE FISH, BITCH!

             IVY
      MOM, PLEASE!

             VIOLET
      Barbara...!

             BARBARA
      Okay, fuck it, do what you want.

             IVY
      I have to tell you something.

             BARBARA
      Ivys a lesbian.

             IVY
      Barbara--

             VIOLET
      No, youre not.

             IVY
      No, Im not--

             BARBARA
      Yes, you are.  Did you eat your fish?

             IVY
      Barbara, stop it!

                                128.


             BARBARA
      Eat your fish.

             IVY
      Barbara!

             BARBARA
      Eat your fish.

             VIOLET
      Barbara, quiet now--

             IVY
      Mom, please, this is important --

             BARBARA
      Eatyourfisheatyourfisheatyourfish--

Ivy stands, hurls her plate of food, smashes it.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      What the fuck --

             IVY
      I have something to say.

             BARBARA
      Are we breaking shit?

Barbara takes a vase from the sideboard, smashes it.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      cause I can break shit --

Violet throws her plate, smashes it.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      See, we can all break shit. 

             IVY
      Charles and I --

             BARBARA
      You dont want to break shit with me, 
      muthah-fuckah --

             IVY
      Charles and I --

             BARBARA
      Johnna?!  Little spill in here!

Ivy gets in Barbaras face.

                                129.


             IVY
      Barbara, stop it!
        (returning to Violet)
      Mom, Charles and I --

             BARBARA
      Little Charles --

             IVY
      Charles and I --

             BARBARA
      Little Charles --

             IVY
      Barbara --

             BARBARA
      You have to say Little Charles or she 
      wont know who youre talking about.

             IVY
      Little Charles and I...

Barbara relents.  Ivy will finally get to say the words.

             IVY
	(CONTD)
      Little Charles and I are --

             VIOLET
      Little Charles and you are brother 
      and sister.  I know that.

Freeze.  Silence.

             BARBARA
      Oh... Mom.

             IVY
      What?  No, listen, Little Charles --

             VIOLET
      Ive always known that.  I told you, 
      no one slips anything by me.

             IVY
      Mom --

             BARBARA
      Dont listen.

                                130.


             VIOLET
      I knew the whole time Bev and Mattie 
      Fae were carrying on.  Charlie should 
      have known too, if he wasnt smoking 
      all that grass.

             BARBARA
      Its the pills talking.

             VIOLET
      Your father tore himself up over it, 
      thirty some-odd years, but Beverly 
      wouldnt have been Beverly if he 
      didnt have plenty to brood about.

             IVY
      Mom, what are you...?

             BARBARA
      Oh honey...

             VIOLET
      Better you girls know now though,  
      now youre older.  Never know when 
      someone might need a kidney.

Ivy looks from Violet to Barbara... suddenly lurches away 
from the table, knocking over her chair.

             IVY
      Why in Gods name did you tell       
      me this?

             VIOLET
      Hey, what do you care?

             IVY
      Youre monsters.

             VIOLET
      Come on now --

             IVY
      Monsters...

             VIOLET
      Whos the injured party here?

Ivy flees from the dining room, pursued by Barbara --


                                131.
INT. FRONT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

             BARBARA
      Ivy, listen --

             IVY
      Leave me alone.

             BARBARA
      When Mattie Fae told me, I didnt 
      know what to do --

Ivy runs from the house.


EXT. WESTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Ivy rushes to her car, still followed by Barbara.

             BARBARA
      I was trying to protect you --

             IVY
      Well go anyway, well still go away.

Ivy gets in the car, starts it, revs the engine.  Barbara 
tries to open the car door.

             BARBARA
      This is not my fault.

Barbara pounds on the car window.

             BARBARA
	(CONTD)
      I didnt tell you, Mom told you!     
      It wasnt me, it was Mom!

The car window slides down.

             IVY
      Theres no difference.

Ivy floors the car, roars out of the driveway, leaving Barb 
standing there.  After a moment, Barb turns, stares up at the 
house, angry, resolute. Starts back inside.

INT. WESTON HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Finds Violet still at the table, lighting a cigarette. 


                                132.


             VIOLET
      We couldnt let Ivy run off with 
      Little Charles.  Just wouldnt be 
      right.

Barbara doesnt respond, keeps her distance.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      Shell be back.  Shes a sweet girl, 
      Ivy, and I love her to death.  But she 
      isnt strong.  Not like you.  Or me.

             BARBARA
      You knew about Daddy and Mattie Fae?

             VIOLET
      Oh sure.  I never told them I knew.  
      But your father knew.  He knew I knew.  
      But we never talked about it.  I chose 
      the higher ground.
        (and then)
      If Id had the chance, there at the 
      end, I wouldve told him, I hope this 
      isnt about Little Charles, cause you 
      know I know all about that.  If Id 
      reached him at that motel, I wouldve 
      said, Youd be better off if you quit 
      sulking about this ancient history.  

             BARBARA
      ...what motel?

             VIOLET
      I called over there on Monday after I 
      got into that safety deposit box. But 
      it was too late, hed checked out. 

             BARBARA
      How did you know where he was?

Violet is growing agitated with the interrogation.

             VIOLET
      The note.  He said I could call him 
      over at the Country Squire Motel --

             BARBARA
      He left a note?

             VIOLET
      And I did, I called him on Monday.

                                133.


             BARBARA
      After you got the money out of your 
      safety deposit box...

             VIOLET
      We had an arrangement. You have to 
      understand, for people like your 
      father and me, who never had any 
      money, ever, as kids, people from our 
      generation, that money is important.

             BARBARA
      If you couldve stopped Daddy from 
      killing himself, you wouldnt have 
      needed to get into your safety deposit 
      box. 

             VIOLET
      Well, hindsights always twenty-
      twenty, isnt it?

Barbara stares at her mother for a long moment.  Then --

             BARBARA
      Did the note say he was going to kill 
      himself?

No response.

             BARBARA
	(CONT'D)
      Mom?

             VIOLET
      If I had my wits about me, I mightve 
      done it different.  But I was, your 
      father and me both, we were...

Barbara looks off, quietly:

             BARBARA
      You were both fucked-up... You were 
      fucked-up... You are fucked-up.

             VIOLET
      Youd better understand this, you  
      smug little ingrate.  Theres only  
      one reason Beverly killed himself and 
      thats you.  Think theres any way he 
      wouldve done what he did if you were 
      still here?  No, just him and me, here 
      in this house, in the dark, left to 
      ourselves, abandoned, wasted lifetimes 
      devoted to your care and comfort.  

                                134.


             VIOLET
	(CONT'D)
      So stick that knife of judgment in me, 
      go ahead, but make no mistake, his 
      blood is just as much on your hands as 
      it is on mine.

Barbara is reeling, trying to comprehend.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      He did this though, not us.  Can you 
      imagine anything more cruel, to make 
      me responsible?  Just to weaken me, 
      make me prove my character?  So I 
      waited, to get my hands on that safety 
      deposit box.  But I would have waited 
      anyway.  You want to show whos 
      stronger, Bev?  Nobodys stronger than 
      me, goddamn it.  When nothing is left, 
      when everything is gone and 
      disappeared, Ill be here.

Violet YELLS up to the empty house.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      Whos stronger now, you son-of-a-
      bitch?!

Barbara feels sick, the floor giving away beneath her.  She 
takes a moment.  Then:

             BARBARA
      Youre right, Mom.  Youre the   
      strong one.

She goes to her mother, kisses her.  Turns, heads into the 
hall, grabs her purse and Bevs keys from the dish. 

Violet only slowly realizes Barbaras gone. 

             VIOLET
      ...Barbara?

Hears the sound of the screen door opening and SLAPPING shut.

             VIOLET 
	(CONTD)

      Barbara?

Violet follows her into the hall, stops at the screen door.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      You and me.  Were alike.

Barb doesnt turn around, keeps moving.  Quietly:

                                135.


             BARBARA
      No...

Sees Barb heading across the yard for Beverlys pick-up.

             VIOLET
      Barbara, please.

             BARBARA
      Im nothing like you...

             VIOLET
      Please, Barbara.

Watches Barbara climb into the truck, back slowly out, go.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      ...Barbara?  

Barbara drives off.  The driveway now empty again.  Violet 
alone outside on the walkway.  She turns back to the house, 
yelling, moving from empty room to empty room.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      Ivy?!  Ivy, you here?!

Silence.  The dining room, the kitchen.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      Barb?!  Ivy?!

And into the living room, Bevs study.

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      Bev?! ...Bev?!

She stumbles to the stereo, puts on her Clapton... stares at 
the spinning album...

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      Johnna?!

She reels to the stairs, crawling up --

INT/EXT. BEVERLYS PICK-UP (MOVING) - DAY

Barbara is nearly catatonic as she drives, the house receding  
in the rear window behind her.

A few large rain drops splatter her windshield, the rumble of 
distant thunder, lightning and towering, ominous clouds in 
the distance.


                                136.
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY/ATTIC STAIRS - DAY

Violet climbs the staircase on all fours. 

             VIOLET
      Johnna... Johnna... Johnna...

Johnna sets down her TS Elliot, goes to Violet, holds 
Violets head, smooths her hair, rocks her.  Quietly --

             VIOLET
	(CONTD)
      And then youre gone, and Beverly,  
      and then youre gone, and Barbara,  
      and then youre gone, and then   
      youre gone, and then youre gone --

Johnna quietly sings to Violet.

	       JOHNNA
	This is the way the world 
	ends...

		VIOLET
	--and then youre gone, and 
	then youre gone --

INT. BEVERLYS PICK-UP - DAY

ON Barbara as she drives --

             JOHNNA
	(OS)
      ...this is the way the world ends, 
      this is the way the world ends...

             VIOLET
	(OS)
      --and then youre gone, and then 
      youre gone...

We stay on Barb as she slowly pulls herself back together.  
Brushes tears from her cheeks.  Laughs darkly.  Notices her 
hands are shaking from the adrenaline.  

Slows, pulls the pick-up to the side of the road at the top 
of a small rise.  Climbs out, stares out over the miles of 
prairie.  The wind gently ruffles her clothing, her hair.  

CLOSE ON her as she settles into exhausted relief, unsure of 
what comes next, but finally on her way as we --

                             FADE TO BLACK.
