EXT. TAGGART FARM. DUSK. 
 
A cornfield in an evening breeze. A lone wooden cross against 
the dusky sky. 
 
WHOMP! A SCARECROW suddenly thrown against it. Sloppy 
looking. Overalls. Pillow sack head. Hat stitched on. 
 
Fourteen year old BILLY TAGGART stands on wooden steps at the 
foot of the post so he can reach this high. 
 
Takes a length of bailing wire and reaches around the straw 
man. Finds himself nose to nose with its sewn on face. 
 

        TAGGART 
 You get number three up and 
 don’t come in to eat till 
 you do. 
  
The boy looks over. JACK TAGGART is a weathered looking 
forty. Working the post puncher across the field. 
 
He slides a long wooden post with a pointed tip into the 
loader and then jumps back onto the seat of the fencing 
machinery. 
 
PRAMP!!! The wooden post is fired deep into the earth -by the 
small cannon of the puncher pointing directly into the 
ground. 
 

        TAGGART 
 And check the other two. 
 Make sure they’re wired up 
 good, I don’t want ‘em 
 blowing down again if 
 there’s a big wind. 

 
Billy stares across the field at TWO MORE SCARECROWS. Already 
on their crosses. A CROW LANDS ON THE MOST DISTANT. IT CAWS 
MAWKISHLY. 
 

        BILLY 
 Lot of good they’re doing. 

 
PRAMP!!! The boy turns to dad to protest. But dad is hopping off the post 
puncher now. It has misfired. 
 

        TAGGART 
 You been messing with this 
 post puncher? 

 

        BILLY 
 No.

            TAGGART
    I told you what’d happen if 
    you screwed around with this 
    thing.

Billy, struggling to secure the first scarecrow.

            BILLY
    I said I didn’t. 

Taggart throws a rag at the post puncher. Moves toward their 
small farmhouse. 

    Jacky?

            TAGGART

Billy’s older brother JACK JR. Seventeen. Sticks his head out 
the kitchen door. 

            TAGGART
    You messin’ around with that 
    Goddamned post puncher 
    again?

    No!

            JACK JR.

Taggart throws a look out to Billy.

            JACK JR.
    Billy you little asshole! 
    Why don’t you fink on 
    yourself for a change?

            TAGGART
    Don’t use that kinda mouth 
    on your brother, what did I 
    tell you?

Jack Taggart disappears inside the barn. Jack Jr. glares at 
little brother. Turns to go back in the kitchen.

Halted by BUTCH their BLACK LABRADOR RETRIEVER, GROWLING IN 
THE DIRECTION OF THE CORNFIELD. 

            JACK JR.
    Go get him! Go bite him in 
    the ass, Butchy-boy. 

Jack Jr. disappears back inside the kitchen. BUTCH BARKS NOW. 
Excitedly. Staring out into the corn where:

*

Billy grumbles to himself on his way to Scarecrow Number Two.

            BILLY
    “Don’t want ‘em blowing down 
    again”...Big wind my ass...”

HE CAN HEAR HIS DOG BARKING IN THE DISTANCE.

            BILLY 
    You’re the only big wind out 
    here...

Billy arrives at the next scarecrow. Walks behind it. Checks 
the bailing wire that holds it in place.

RAKING ANGLE ON BILLY AND THE FAR SCARECROW                           : The last 
scarecrow, some yards away, turns and looks at the boy, 
scattering the crows on its head and shoulders...

Billy turns to look...

RACK FOCUS TO:       --the scarecrow. It looks away at the same 
instant. 

Billy wondering what he saw. 

The dog still at the outskirts of the corn rows, YELPING NOW. 
A CLEAR WARNING TO THE BOY...

DOG POV  : Billy moves toward that last scarecrow. 

THE DOG’S BARKS BUILD IN INTENSITY. Wants to go after his 
master. Won’t. Too afraid. 

           BILLY 
    Will you shut-up?!

Billy glaring out at his dog. Realizes something. Turns 
toward that last scarecrow -just a yard or so away.

Are his eyes are playing tricks on him?

This scarecrow is not one of the sloppy ones he made himself. 
This one wears a strange hat and a thick, long coat...

THE DOG BARKING INSANELY AGAIN...

This doesn’t look like a scarecrow at all...

BILLY TURNS. STARTS TO RUN. DOESN’T KNOW WHY.  SPRINTING 
THROUGH CORN. IT SLAPS AT HIM HE IS MOVING SO FAST. 

THE SCARECROW BLASTS OFF THE POST TOWARD HIM---

Not running --but flying after him!  A big dark shape, 
rocketing over the stalks!

Before he can even think what kind of nightmare it must be--
KER-RANCCHHH!!! IT TAKES THE KID DOWN WITH A FLYING TACKLE. 

THE CORN SHAKES VIOLENTLY WHERE THEY HIT THE GROUND. THE DOG 
BARKING INSANELY. 

                                (CONTINUED)

Like A Bat Out of Hell: Jeepers Creepers II   2/16/02          4            

Dad bursting from the barn with a double barrel shoutgun. 
Jack Jr. scrambling out the kitchen door in his bare feet.

The corn still shakes violently. Taggart running into the 
field toward it.

    BILLY?!

           TAGGART

SOMETHING IS MOVING THROUGH THE CORN AWAY FROM TAGGART WITH 
INCREDIBLE SPEED.

Taggart filling with fear as he runs faster. The dog follows 
with Jack Jr.

           TAGGART
    BILLY?!!!!!!

They’re gaining on it --something big is dragging something 
not so big, deeper into the field.

BILLY’S POV     : ANGLE LOOKING UP AT THE RAGMAN DRAGGING HIM. 

Both men and the dog in the trail of broken stalks now. 
Running over one of Billy’s tennis shoes...

           TAGGART
    BILLY?!!!!!!

SOMETHING BIG BREAKS OUT OF THE CORN AHEAD! STARTLING THE 
TAGGARTS! ROCKETING OUT OF THE STALKS INTO THE NIGHT...

It wears a scarecrow’s ragged coat and from it, great wings 
that rise and fall -blasting it skyward--

A HORRID SHAPE THAT CLUTCHES ANOTHER. ITS PREY DANGLING FROM 
ITS TALONS...

There can be no mistaking the lifeless body of young Billy 
Taggart being raced into the cloudy night sky.

Dad stares completely transfixed. Shot gun leveled but unable 
to shoot. Might hit Billy. 

THE DOG BARKS WILDLY up at the horrible thing that is now a 
distant shape streaking past the cloudy moon. 

AS IT DISAPPEARS THERE COMES A SOUND SO EERIE AND FORLORN IT 
COULD ALMOST BE THE VOICE OF JACK TAGGART’S HORROR AND 
SORROW...

A HOWLING SOUND. THE DOG. IT HOWLS UP AT THE MOON.

Taggart and Jack Jr. stare up nullified at the moon that 
looks down on them.

AS A DIALOG PRELAP OF SINGING BEGINS:

            BOYS AND GIRLS
    Tough as Nails! Hard as Rocks! 
    We are Bannon’s Fighting 
    Cocks! 

    Fighting Bantams, tough as 
    nails! Bow down now or kiss 
    our tails!

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY. 

Climbing a rise into view on this remote country two-lane is 
a big yellow school bus. BANNON COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT the 
legend on its sides. 

                            SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

           BOYS AND GIRLS
    Out for blood we’re lean and 
    mean! Bannon County’s death 
    machine!

INT. SCHOOL BUS. DAY. SAME TIME.

Long shot down the aisle: A Varsity Basketball team singing 
their fight song on a long journey home from an away game. 

A tired but happy crew of 20 BOYS, THEIR COACHES AND 
CHEERLEADERS.

HEAD COACH CHARLIE HANNA, capable looking man of Color, 
listening as they sing THE BANNON COUNTY BANTAMS FIGHT SONG.

           BOYS AND GIRLS
    Bannon Bantams, Bannon Bantams
    Gooooooooooo BAN--TAMS!!!!

Boys on one side have a long cloth banner on their laps 
running the length of the bus.

           BOYS AND GIRLS
    Bannon Bantams power and  might! 
    Bannon Bantam’s! Fight! Fight! 
    Fight! 
    Bannon Bantams we’re the word! 
    You don’t mess with a mighty 
    bird.

    Down the court we’ll clean 
    your clock. Better not mess 
    with a fighting cock!

At the back of the bus we arrive at handsome and powerful 
SCOTT BRADDOCK. Brooding. The only player not singing.

Two of the cheerleaders on the bus, RHONDA TRUITT and CHELSEA 
FARMER. Chelsea is a beautiful girl of Color. Neither  
exactly enjoying the din.

           RHONDA
       (over the noise)
    How long can they keep this 
    up?

           CHELSEA
    Forever, they have a fight 
    song with the word “cock” in 
    it.

She looks over at MINXIE HAYES the third cheerleader. Happily 
chanting along with the boys.

           RHONDA
    Surprised Minxie’s not 
    waving her pom poms.

           CHELSEA

    She is.
       (looks back)
    How come you’re not sitting 
    with your honey?

Both girls turn to look back at sullen Scott Braddock.

           CHELSEA
    He’s not singing.

           RHONDA
    I have a feeling he didn’t 
    get to play enough.

           CHELSEA
    Well shouldn’t you be 
    sitting with him?

           RHONDA
    After a game he says he 
    needs to be with the guys.

           CHELSEA
    You kill his post game buzz, 
    huh?

           RHONDA
    Basically. 
       (looks back at him)
    If they lose it’s a totally 
    different thing. Can’t pry 
    him off me.

Seeing a car approaching, BETTY BORMAN, the bus driver lays 
on the horn and waves it ahead.

EXT. LONELY COUNTRY ROAD. DAY. SAME TIME.

The car picks up speed. Travels alongside the bus. Reading 
the banner that the boys hold up along the windows:
BANNON STATE BASKETBALL CHAMPIONS
Betty Borman lays on the horn in playful spurts. HONK-HONK-HA-
HONK-HONK!

Bird’s eye view        : Big countryside dwarfing the tiny bus as the 
car passes it. THE SINGING VOICES FAINT AT THIS ALTITUDE.

INT. SCHOOL BUS. DAY. SAME TIME.

The only two boys on the bus who are non-team members, IZZY 
BOHEN -who is not singing- and Student Team Manager ANDY 
“BUCKY” BUCK who is.

JAKE SPENCER plops down in the seat behind them and leans 
forward. 

    Hey Izzy? 

           JAKE

           IZZY
       (not interested)
    Hey Jake.

           JAKE
    You saw me, right? Run that 
    full court dash, you see 
    that?

           IZZY
    Yeah I saw it.

           JAKE
    Anyone gonna read about it?
       (off Izzy’s look)
    Why you give old Dante back 
    there so much ink, huh?

They look at handsome DANTE BELASCO at the back of the bus.

           JAKE 
    I’m serious, people’re 
    starting to think you’re 
    sweet on him.

           IZZY
    Really, I heard that was 
    you.

           IZZY

    That’s my name-

           JAKE
    -or Isn’t he?”

Izzy glowers at him.  PWOOM!! The bus suddenly jolts.

Kids everywhere jolted in their seats. Bus Driver Borman 
struggling to keep control of the big machine.

EXT. SCHOOL BUS. DAY. SAME TIME.

A flat tire. Ripped rubber slapping the asphalt as the bus 
leans to the right. 

INT. SCHOOL BUS. DAY. SAME TIME.

Bus Driver Betty Borman wrestles the big yellow vehicle onto 
the shoulder of the road.

Coach Hanna watches her move out from behind the wheel. 

           COACH HANNA
    Everybody sit tight.

EXT. SCHOOL BUS. DAY. SAME TIME.

Betty and Hanna step down and move to the rear of the bus. 
Shredded rubber hangs off the outer right rear tire.

Betty Borman squats to it. Spies something embedded deep in 
one of the rubber flaps.

It is smooth and metallic. Star shaped. One of the points of 
the star clearly what flattened the tire.

           BUS DRIVER BETTY
    Son-of-a...

She pries it free. Something very ornate and ancient looking 
about it.

Neither like what they’re thinking. Both look around. Just 
fields and fields. Where did this thing come from?

INT. SCHOOL BUS. DAY. SAME TIME.

Scott Braddock and his cronies in the backseats: Jake, 
handsome DANTE BELASCO and JONNY YOUNG all staring out the 
rear window. Coach Hanna and Bus Driver Betty having a 
discussion they can’t hear.

           BRADDOCK
    You sucked so bad today 
    Double D., they’re probably 
    saying you gotta fix the 
    flat.

Several seats ahead, DEAUNDRE “DOUBLE D.” DAVIS, a handsome 
young man of color, responds with a single finger. Double 
D.’s best buddy KIMBALL WARD takes his headphones off.

           KIMBALL
    They’re up to one hundred 
    and sixty-seven.

Bucky and Izzy turn back to them.

    That is some scary shit, 
    ‘yall. I heard they were all 
    sewn together like some kind 
    of blanket of the dead...

           IZZY
    My dad says some of the 
    bodies they found? False 
    teeth made out of wood.
       (off the others looks)
    Means they’re finding bodies 
    down there that are two 
    Centuries old.

    like to do that right now.

He is staring toward the front of the bus at cheerleader 
Minxie who throws him a look.

    I’d love to just whip it out 
    and start pumping it up, 
    right now.

    I don’t either. It’s like a

    It’s a six wheeler, that

Long way to limp, isn’t it? 

BUS DRIVER BETTY
    They decide to send someone, 
‘still gonna be a while. 

She steps back onto the bus. The Coach still staring at the 
strange metal object. Did this flatten their tire?  

He holds it up again. The large metal chip dissolves into the 
burning sun as we:

                                DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TAGGART FARM. LATE DAY.

Examining where little brother disappeared, a breeze bows the 
corn stalks around Jack Jr. and his dog. 

In the long drag trail of broken stalks the teen, shotgun 
tucked under his arm, pushes husks around with the toe of his 
boot.

THEN BUTCH WHIMPERS at something. The dog sniffing at 
something hidden under the trampled leaves. 

ANGLE ON GROUND LOOKING UP AT                 : Jack Jr. hands on knees stares 
down at it.

INT. TAGGART LIVING ROOM. LATE DAY. SAME TIME.

Jack Taggart in an old overstuffed chair. Looking like a 
still life. Staring off into the shadows. Shades drawn. He 
has been there for hours, sitting in the dark.

CAN HEAR THE DOG BARKING WILDLY OUTSIDE. CAN HEAR JACK JR. 
BURSTING IN THE KITCHEN DOOR.

He rushes into the living room. Halted by how dark it is. 

Jack Jr. moves forward. Offering his discovery in his open 
palm. Taggart doesn’t move. 

    Look, pop.

            JACK JR.

But dad doesn’t. Doesn’t even blink. That stare so dead.

            JACK JR.
    It was out in the corn. 

Taggart finally looks to his son’s open palm. Stares for a 
moment at the object. Looks up to his boy as he slowly takes 
it in his own fingers: 

A smooth, star shaped piece of metal. Strikingly similar to 
the thing we have just seen pulled out of the bus tire.

EXT. LONLEY COUNTRY ROAD. LATE DAY.

HIGH ANGLE LOOKING DOWN             : 

Boys trek out from the stranded bus into the expansive field. 
The bus itself, littered with half naked bodies angled all 
along the roof. 

Braddock and his cronies have laid out up there. Jake, Dante, 
Jonny, and others. Eyes closed. Basking in the late day sun.

Beto a few yards from the bus, watching the wagon roll by.

BUS DRIVER BETTY

    You get through?

The Coach shakes his head no. Realizes this old truck might 
be their only chance to contact someone. He waves.

It immediately picks up speed.

Everyone on the bus laughs. Until the ice cream truck brakes 
to a sudden halt.

THE ICE CREAM TUNE STOPS TOO. 

Beto has quickly lost his bravado. The rusty old wagon sits 
in the middle of the two lane, idling roughly.

It sends burps of nasty looking smoke out the broken exhaust.

Coach Hanna about to round the driver side. Can almost see

EXT. TAGGART FARM. DUSK.

The dusky sky silhouettes the cornfields of the Taggart farm. 

SOUNDS OF LABOR move us toward the barn, past the post 
puncher on its’ side. Parts of it laying on tarps.

Beyond that, Jack Jr. in safety goggles. Works in a shower of 
sparks. Welding in the bed of an old pick-up truck.

Butch the dog lays in the long shadows of the dying sun as 
the flickers and flashes and glow of welding ignite the 
doorway of the old barn as well.

Inside someone works diligently in another fountain of 
sparks. 

CLANK!!  Thrown down on a workplate is s long, nasty-looking 
piece of metal. With a ferociously pointed tip. A spear? A 
harpoon?

The welder’s mask comes up for a moment and we look into the 
eyes of Jack Taggart. 

He stares ahead with that same look of the dead, tainted only 
by the small welling in his eyes. A look full of purpose. 

SLOW PUSH IN      : 

The metal disc found in the cornfield has been nailed to the 
post at the center of the barn. The fiery sparks reflect in it 
as Taggart returns to work.

Bus Driver Betty flips open the emergency road kit and tosses 
Jake another flashlight. A flare too. 

Betty and Jake step onto the shoulder. Barnes pops his head 
back in the bus.

           COACH BARNES
       (to Bucky)
    Close these doors.

Bucky just stares.

    Close ‘em!

           COACH BARNES

Barnes joins the others on the shoulder as Bucky grabs the 
handle and closes the doors. Looks back at the team.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

The three adults move toward the old wagon and Jake to the 
rear of the bus.

THAT RUSTY OLD ICE CREAM TUNE ECHOING ACROSS THE FIELDS...

Jake looks in the distance. Just moonlit road as far as the 
eye can see. THUNK-THUNK-THUNK!

Banging on the rear window of the bus. Jake flicks on the 
flashlight. Braddock, Jonny and Dante flipping him off.

At the ice cream truck, Borman goes to get behind the wheel.

           COACH BARNES
    Don’t Betty. Better let me 
    or Charlie. 

           BUS DRIVER BETTY
    Gimme the flashlight-

           COACH BARNES
    I mean it Betty-

Betty grabs the flashlight away from Barnes. Cautiously peers 
inside with Coach Hanna.

BODIES. WRAPPED AND ROPED IN BLOODY SHEETS. SEVEN AT LEAST. 
MORE HANGING FROM HOOKS ON EITHER SIDE. ONE HOOK STILL 
EMPTY... 

Hanna and Betty staring. Both immobilized by this horrible 
sight. BANG! Barnes has hit the side of the truck, jarring them.

           COACH BARNES
    Okay can we do this 
    Goddammit?!

           BUS DRIVER BETTY
    I’m not getting inside this 
    thing!

Coach Hanna forces himself into the driver seat. Fumbles with 
switches until the ICE CREAM TUNE STOPS.

Releases the emergency brake. Betty and Coach Barnes at the 
back of the truck, preparing to push it forward. 

           COACH HANNA
    Okay, let it roll.

The ice cream truck rolls forward. Hanna pilots it onto the 
soft dirt shoulder. 

FWISSSSHHHHHH!!!!  The flare ignites in Jake’s hands. Its 
redness etching his face. He moves down the two-lane. Drops it.

THUNK! THUNK! THUNK! on the back window again. Turns this 
time to see three naked asses mooning him. 

INT. BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

The kids are staring at the back of the bus. Braddock, Jonny 
and Dante continue mooning. Make cat-calls and hooting 
sounds.

ANGLE ON KIDS W/COACHES AND BORMAN THRU WINDSHIELD                                :

The Coaches and Betty on their way back in the throw of the 
headlights. Izzy leans across the aisle to Andy Buck.

    Why is it the “straightest

    the ones who find an excuse 
    to flash their asses to each 
    other?

Out the windshield -Coach Hanna is picked up right off his 
feet.

Barnes and Borman barely have time to flinch  AS HANNA IS 
CARRIED UP OVER THE BUS AND OUT OF VIEW...

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Jake at the end of the bus can hear THE COACH’S SCREAMS and 
looks up.

In time to see the man flying high overhead. Rocketing across 
the night sky, flailing arms and legs. 

Whatever has him is too dark to see!

Jake turns to the back window. Braddock, Jonny and Dante are 
laughing at him, pulling up their pants. Oblivious.

The only two people on board who saw it happen --Minxie and 
Beto-- just stare with open mouths.

Borman and Barnes looking up at the sky in a daze. And Coach

Beto has no words. Just shakes his head ‘no’. As if refusing 
to comment because he still can’t believe it. 

EXT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Jake banging on the rear window. Pointing up in the sky. 
Dante, Jonny and Braddock confused as they peer up.

Jake rushes toward the front of the bus. Meets Betty and 
Coach Barnes. They have no words. 

All three just staring. Pale faces staring skyward.

INT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Braddock coming out of his seat.

           BRADDOCK
    Where the Hell’s the coach, 
    Beto?!

    Something picked him up. 

    What?

           BRADDOCK

           BETO

Everyone looks at Minxie for a second opinion. All she can do 
is nod her head.

Someone outside slams on the doors and Bucky opens them. Jake 
blasts on board. Stopped instantly by the stares of everyone.

           IZZY
    What’s going on out there?

Jake just stands breathless. Out the windows: Betty Borman 
moves into the field. Flashlight beam streaking the sky.

    Charlie?!

           BUS DRIVER BETTY

Coach Barnes on the bus steps. Shaken but trying not to show 
it.

Hit with such force his hands grip the steel bannisters of 
the steps.

He looks down. Eyes as wide as they can go. 

GREAT GRAY TALONS ARE SUNK DEEP INTO HIS SHOULDERS. 

Before he can scream he is ripped off his feet! Grappling the 
bannisters for dear life!

Braddock reaches out-- just catches Barnes by the lower legs. 
Bucky, Double D., Kimball, and Izzy jump onto Braddock!

BARNES SCREAMS AS A TERRIBLE TUG OF WAR BEGINS...

The talons pull him higher! His head comes up into the night

bus.

enough to move all of them!

Betty Borman screaming toward the bus from the field. Her

Barnes flailing madly in the clutches of something dark and 
ragged --impossibly perched on the roof of the bus. Massive 
wings flapping on its back?

SHWUNK!!! Barnes dragged further up. Out of view now except 
for his legs. Braddock and the others hanging on get yanked 
up too.

EXT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Barnes catching a quick flash of a horrible mouth. Rows of 
small razor-edged teeth. BARNES SCREAMS AS--

Breathless Betty arriving just in time to see BARNES DRAGGED 
INTO THE SKY. 

INT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Kids diving for windows. Crowding them. Cramming them.  
Trying to see where the Coach is going.

CAN ONLY HEAR HIM SCREAM ALL THE WAY UP INTO OBLIVION.... 

Betty looks down at Braddock at the bottom of the steps. Then 
fast she helps him up. Practically throws him back on the bus 
and dives for the handle to the bus doors. 

THA-WONK!!! Betty pulls the bus doors closed. 

Catches her breath and turns to look down the shadowy bus.  
The whole team staring back at her in shock. 

She moves quickly into the driver’s seat and turns the engine 
over. 

    Betty...

           BRADDOCK

She looks back. Braddock in the middle of the aisle. His 
voice a whisper:

    wings.

Minxie hears it first. Rises slowly out of her seat. Eyes 
fixed above her.

WOOOSSHHHHH!!!!! An inky black smear flies past the right 
side of the bus- big enough to blot out the moonlight in each 
window as it speeds by.

SOME KIND OF WAILING SOUND AS IT PASSED... 

People out of their seats, trying to follow its trajectory. 
Watching out the back window. No sign of it. This thing was 
big and it was fast.

Frightened looks. Unspoken fear everywhere. They close their 
windows. Slide them up and shut. Locking them.

WOOOSSHHHHH!!!!! It rips down the left side of the bus in the 
other direction now, swooping up to avoid all but the tiniest 
throw of light from the high beams. 

Something utterly unreal is buzzing the school bus...

Grinds the gears.

noisily into the bed of Jack Taggart’s old pick up.

Jack Jr. watches this. He is in the bed of the old truck 
tightening bolts on the crude, makeshift pulpit situated 
behind the cab.

One look at dad and his son knows what to do. 

The boy throws down the wrench and hops out of the truck bed. 
Dad swings into the passenger seat. Switches on the police 
scanner above him.

around the yard in a U-turn and races down the drive toward

Minxie whirls around and waves her arms to silence everyone. 
Her pale look panics Izzy and Braddock --as she motions ever 
so quietly behind her. 

The boys move cautiously forward. 

ANGLE CREEPING AROUND THE PARTITION                      : The doors come into 
view. A dark, cloaked figure is staring in. 

The brim of a ragged hat shadows its face. What it wears 
could be rags from a scarecrow.

Nullified faces staring back at it. Braddock waving madly for 
everyone to “get down and lay low.”

Everyone ducks down below window level. Seats visible from 
the bus doors empty quickly and quietly.

Its bowed head raises up. Nose almost touching the panes of 
the doors. There can be no mistake --it is trying to sniff 
through the glass.

Izzy steps back, bumping into Braddock. He stumbles and by 
the time they right themselves

 --the figure is no longer at the doors.

A silent panic filters down the bus. Faces huddled below the 
windows in every seat. 

Jake braves a peek above window level. The Creeper’s face 
raising up with his.

*

Only its eyes are closed. In the middle of a deep inhale. 

Jake ducks down quickly again, his flashlight clutched to him.

The Creeper’s eyes open. Strain to look down at him.  He is 
practically under his seat now and staring across the aisle 
to Rhonda and others caught by its:

..strange, grayish skin. Claw-like tentacles around its face. 
Dark, strangely human eyes harbored in that clearly inhuman 
head.

It presses its face closer to the glass as it inhales again. 
Seems to savor the surrounding air.

Tracing in it, a path that leads down to Jake again. About to 
move. Rhonda shakes her head ‘no’ --stops him.

Jake looks more like a frightened boy than one of the biggest 
boys on the Varsity team. Looks at Rhonda helplessly.

The Creeper surprises everyone when it backs away from the 
window now and starts walking down the length of the bus.

Jake looking back at the rear door. The one he tied shut with 
a gym towel.

THONG! The door opens as much as the towel will allow. 

Everyone flailing back. Izzy brandishing the javelin as a 
weapon. Dante levels the flare gun. Jake blasts the rear door 
with the flashlight. 

No Creeper can be seen. UNTIL A SUDDEN AND STACCATO SNIFFING 
DRAWS EVERYONE’S ATTENTION LOWER. To the small opening where 
the door won’t close all the way.

inhuman rapidity...

The Creeper rises up in the door window now. Eyes peering in. 
Somehow singling Dante out of the mass of cowering kids.

Dante immobilized by the wicked smile, the rows of teeth.  
Almost flinches when it winks at him.

    real!

The Creeper’s grayish hand moves inside the door now. Grips 
it. It drops its head back and takes an even deeper inhale.

Like a gourmet chef enjoying the bouquet of a savory dish.

This time it stops mid-sniff. Turns slowly into the window. 
This time pressing its nose to the glass.

Eyes leveling at the terrified kids staring back at it.

The Creeper’s grey and leathery hand curls those hideous 
fingers and points directly at them.

Braddock points to himself. You mean me?

The Creeper lowers his brow. Eyes burning out. Keeps pointing.

Braddock turns slowly to see who is standing behind him. Who is  *

thing black against the moonlit clouds.

INT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Jake slams the emergency door shut. Holds the door closed 
again. Breathless. Rhonda grabs onto Braddock. He holds her.

Minxie staring out the windshield with others. Her eyes roll 
up into her head and she faints dead away. Bucky and Izzy 
catch her, drag her to a seat. 

FRAME WASHES OUT AS          : 

Bucky and others look down at her with great concern... 

EXT. DREAM CORNSCAPE. DAY.

Minxie rises slowly into frame staring ahead at:

The Taggart farm’s cornfield.  Someone moving toward her 
through the corn. 

Afraid at first, she realizes as the figure nears,  this is a 
boy her age. Shirtless. Trance-like. A rose tatoo around his 
navel...

DARRY JENNER STEPS OUT OF THE CORN. He is naked. And has a 
dark, dazed look about him as he stares at Minxie. Then 
raises a hand.

She won’t take it so he gently reaches down and takes hers. 
Pulls her gently into the corn.

Minxie is confused. Can see he is leading her toward a 
distant scarecrow on its post.

SHE CAN HEAR DISTANT AND GUTTURAL SOUNDS. GARBLED WORDS FROM 
A DEEP, ANIMAL LIKE THROAT. 

As Darry pulls her nearer to it, she can see its tattered 
rags flapping in a soft breeze.

THE VOICE GROWS LOUDER AND MORE CONFUSING. SOME CHANT OF 
WORDS THAT SHE CANNOT MAKE OUT. A SCRAMBLED STRING OF WORDS 
THAT STOPS ABRUPTLY AS THEY ARRIVE BEFORE THE SCARECROW.

She has to look up at it. The sun glints behind it as Minxie 
takes a tentative step past Darry, staring up.

    What?

           MINXIE

The answer comes from Darry.

           DARRY
    Every 23rd Spring, for 23 
    days, it gets to eat.

           MINXIE
    To eat what?

She turns as she ask the question -Darry is now a horrific 
mess. His face is cut and his eyes sockets are empty. Looking 
exactly like he did the last time we saw him.

    Eat us.

           DARRY

BEHIND MINXIE THE SCARECROW’S RAGS ERUPT AS A MASSIVE PAIR OF 
WINGS EXPLODE FROM ITS BACK. THE SOUND IS SO WICKED IT 
STARTLES HER--

INT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Startling Izzy, Bucky and everyone else looking down at her --
Minxie lurches out of her faint with a full volume gasp. 

    Minx’!

           CHELSEA

Minxie’s eyes open. Normal again. She is breathless. Sweat on 
her brow. She clutches the back of the seat above her.

She holds the back of a seat. Puts her forehead on it.

    It wanted to scare us.

Jake really has the back door sealed now --lashing it shut 
with the last of a nylon rope and a piece of broken javelin.

    It’s like a hawk or

Braddock gets everyone’s attention. He leaves Rhonda. 
Crouches in the middle of the aisle, like a Captain about to 
call a play.

           BRADDOCK
    One guy. Someone fast. We 
    give him the flare gun or 
    something.

    Give him anything we can to 
    help defend himself -but he 
    takes off into the field.

Stunned looks everywhere. Did he just say that?

    Whatever the Hell it is, it 
    can’t come after everyone. 
    What’s it gonna do if we all

doors. Shoots his beam through the glass.

Plugs it into the AC Adapter in the bus’ dash.

            BRADDOCK
    There’s a way to work this 
    so we get the coach back 
    here and get out to that 
    truck-

           IZZY
    Scotty listen to me. My dad 
    works for the paper, right? 
    The Herald?

Braddock takes a step toward Izzy.

           BRADDOCK
    Give Beto the javelin, Izzy. 

           IZZY
    That shit in Poho County? 

           BRADDOCK
    The javelin--

           IZZY
    -that Church Scotty-- 

           BRADDOCK
    I don’t give a rat’s fucking 
    ass-

           IZZY
    --has about a million 
    fucking bodies sewn to the 
    walls--

Braddock grabs Izzy --in one angry move snatches the javelin 
from him, holds him against the driver’s partition by the 
throat and levels the sharp point of the spear between Izzy’s 
eyes.

           IZZY
    I’m trying to tell you, 
    whatever that thing is, I 
    think it’s been snatching 
    bodies for Centuries now and 
    nothing’s been able to stop 
    it!

       (grabs Braddock’s 
        arm as he tightens 
        his grip)
    Nothing man! Not the whole 
    fucking Sheriff’s Department 
    down there in Poho...

           DOUBLE D.
    Let him go, Scotty.

Double D. is behind Braddock. Has put a hand on his shoulder.

            DOUBLE D.
    You’re getting crazy, man.

            BRADDOCK
    You take that hand off me or 
    there is gonna be a lot more 
    blood on that asphalt out 
    there.

            DOUBLE D.
    You wanna get out to that 
    truck then take a walk. 

Braddock whirls around and faces off with Double D. 

            DOUBLE D.
    Don’t use Beto to run 
    interference.

Beto and Dante making eye contact. Purposeful glares. Daring 
each other.

           BRADDOCK
    You wanna play cock of the 
    walk right now?

           DOUBLE D.
    No man, we got bigger fish 
    to fry.

           BRADDOCK
       (a step toward him)
    I don’t give a shit, you 
    wanna play cock of the walk, 
    “bro”?  

           DOUBLE D.
    Why do I think you wanna 
    call me something else?

Braddock glares at him -polarized by this question.

           DOUBLE D.
    You wanna call me something 
    else, Scotty? 
    ‘Cause I don’t think you 
    get, that I can see you 
    thinking it --whether you 
    say it or not.

           BRADDOCK
    You wanna be Captain of this 
    ship Double D.? 

Kimball starts to move next to his friend Double D.

            RHONDA
    Both of you sit down, Scotty 
    what are you doing --the 
    Coach is out there and he’s 
    hurt!

Coach Hanna’s voice wafting to them again.

           COACH HANNA
    Somebody please!

KE-RUNNKK!!!!  The bus doors open. All heads turn. Beto has 
done this. He snatches up the short piece of javelin and runs 
off the bus.

           BETO
       (to Dante)
    You coming?

Dante takes a look at his flare gun and runs down the bus 
steps. Izzy incredulous. Dashes after them onto the two-lane. 

EXT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Bucky wastes no time in closing the doors again. Watching in 
horror with the rest of the team out the windows at:

Izzy catches up to Beto and Dante. Heads them off.

           IZZY
    Come on Beto, what the fuck 
    are you doing here?!

           BETO
       (shoves past Izzy)

           IZZY
    Shut the fuck up!
       (eyes skyward)
    Come on Dante, just get your 
    ass back on that bus!

Dante looks at Izzy. Both boys terrified.

           IZZY
    What are you doing?

Beto continues on looking skyward. 

           DANTE

       (scared not angry)
    The fuck you will too, do it 
    for me.

Izzy staring at Dante until they are blasted suddenly by the 
spotlight from the bus. 

It sweeps across the field and Beto follows its long train to 
the Coach’s distant figure in the deeper grass. 

    Coach...

           BETO

    I’m here! 

           COACH HANNA

Izzy watches as Dante and Beto move deeper into the field. 
Torn between wanting to go back or to follow. 

Instead waves his arms at the bus to get them to stop using 
the spotlight. It goes dark.

INT. BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Braddock and Jake at the windows watching with the others.

           BRADDOCK
    Now.
       (off Jake’s look)
    If it’s out there, it’s 
    distracted. We go for the 
    truck.

Braddock takes center aisle and heads for the doors.

    Hey, that truck’s not just 
    your personal way outta

    They’re almost to him.

Braddock and Jake again to the windows watching.

Beto and Dante nearing the shadowy figure of the Coach. 

           BETO
    You think you can move?

           COACH HANNA
    I’m gonna bust my ass 
    trying...

           BETO
    We can maybe do a fireman’s 
    carry or something...

           COACH HANNA
    I just need some shoulders 
    next to me to take the 
    weight off this leg.

Beto and Dante slowing. Can’t make out the Coach very well.

           COACH HANNA
    Right here man. 

Dante swings the flare gun up. Halts with Beto.

           COACH HANNA
    Jesus, where the Hell is 
    everyone?

           BETO
    They all wanted to help 
    Coach.

           COACH HANNA
    What do you mean, you can’t 
    do this by yourself!

           BETO

       (sounding angrier)
    Well thank fucking Christ I 
    got at least two boys on my 
    team who know how to act 
    like men!

But Beto and Dante can see in the moonlight that something is 
wrong with Coach Hannah.

WE ARE MOVING BEHIND             COACH HANNA: He has a hand buried in the 
back of his skull.

            CREEPER/HANNA
    Boys who have the sack to 
    come out here and save my 
    broken ass!

THE CREEPER’S HAND. WORKING HANNA’S MOUTH FROM THE BACK OF 
THE HEAD --LIKE A PUPPETEER WORKS A PUPPET.

            CREEPER/HANNA
    I gotta tell you something 
    Beto, I really thought I was 
    gonna be left out here. 

The Creeper, wiping his bloody mouth with his free hand, 
SPEAKS IN THE VOICE OF COACH HANNA.

            CREEPER/HANNA
    I really thought you were 
    all gonna just leave my ass 
    out here -all you delicious 
    little motherfuckers back 
    there on that bus.

Beto and Dante paling. The Creeper staring at them.

            CREEPER/HANNA
    Just sitting in there 
    smelling so good and being 
    so tasty back there on that 
    Goddamned bus...

Izzy still point man halfway between the bus and the Coach. 
Hears a scream. Turns and looks:

SLOW MOTION     : Beto and Dante dashing back toward him --as 
something dark and winged rips out of the grass behind them 
and into the air.

INT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Angle behind Braddock and Jake moving down the bus steps. 
Doors still closed -through them they can see Dante’s flare 
gun go off. Its red rocket arcing over the field.

Those on the bus watching their approach. Horrified. Conflicted.  *

The boys are to the asphalt now. Looking back and up. No sign 
of the Creeper -or of the doors opening.

    Bucky!!!

           IZZY

Bucky stares paralyzed as WHAM!! WHAM!! WHAM!! All three boys 
hit the glass doors hard. But only Beto is gone before they 
hit.

Fast. As if the darkness just swallowed him the moment before 
he hit the bus.

Izzy and Dante banging on the glass. Dawning on them Beto is 
gone. Them staring up into the night sky. Can see nothing in 
the moonlit clouds. 

Izzy whirls now. Glares in at Bucky. Before he can even 
scream at him, Bucky opens the bus doors and Dante and Izzy 
spill up the stairs.

INT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Izzy is so angry he falls onto Bucky and starts wailing on 
him. 

EXT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

A distant view of the violence on the bus. Angry voices as 
Izzy is pulled off Bucky. It is quiet again. Quiet and still.

AS WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL               : Beto’s ragged tennis shoe on the 
two-lane in the shadow of the bus.

    Man, this thing is cooked.

Braddock stares at it a moment longer and nods to Bucky.

            BRADDOCK
    Get that door open.
       (to everyone)
    We go. Now. 

            CHELSEA
    It’s dead, right?

            BRADDOCK
    Don’t know, don’t care. 
    Bucky?!

Bucky is really pulling that handle but it won’t give.

            BUCKY
    Something got screwed up! 

Others come to help. Double D. slams against the doors while 
others grapple the handle with Izzy. 

            BRADDOCK
       (moves to Jake)
    Get that shit off the exit 
    and get it open!

Jake looks at him like easy for you to say.  He motions to 
the severely sealed up rear door.

Braddock starts pulling at the ropes. The bus rocks as Double 
D. slams into the doors at the front of the bus.

Frantic activity ALL STOPPED BY THE GROWING SOUND OF GROANING 
METAL...

*

Loud and louder now... Kids turning toward the center of the 
bus.  Some recoiling into their seats...

KEE-RANNKK!!! THE SPLIT IN THE ROOF GIVES WAY AND A GIANT 
WING CRASHES INTO THE CENTER OF THE BUS.

Kids flee in both directions -until the gray dust settles and 
reveals the massive wing is not moving. 

It is however dividing the bus into two sections: fore and 
aft. 

Most stand silent in a kind of awe of the wing’s incredible 
physiognomy. Translucent from one side in the flashlight 
beam.

           BUCKY
    What in the Hell are we 
    looking at?

Braddock storms back to Jake again.

    Come on!

           BRADDOCK

           JAKE
    I made it so it wouldn’t 
    open, man! Someone give me a 
    knife or something!

They pull at the knots in the ropes again.

           KIMBALL
       (nods to the others in the 
        front half of the bus)
    Come on, D’. Everybody. This 
    side.

The thought of having to traverse the wing is not a happy 
one. No one wants to be the first. 

           DOUBLE D.
    I am not gonna touch that 
    thing!

           KIMBALL
    This is the way out man, you 
    just gonna sit back there 
    and wait for the Red Cross? 
    Get your ass over here.

Double D. approaches the wing warily. Studies it closely. 
Starts to climb around it. Over seats to avoid contact.

    Oh man, show like you got a 
    pair...

    Fuck you.

           DOUBLE D.

Double D. comes down behind the wing -on the back half of the 
bus. Chelsea is closest. But she shakes her head ‘no’. 

Izzy pushes his way through. Steps to the wing. Stares at it.

Doesn’t climb over the seats. Is feeling braver. He squeezes 
around it.

Has to push against it to clear his path and realizes its 
folding capabilities.

           IZZY
    This thing’s like a fucking 
    shower curtain man. Look.

He folds the wing up a bit. A nervous laugh. Does it again. 
This time really high. Walks under it to the other side. 
Turns and lets Chelsea and Rhonda step under it as he holds 
it up high.

    Come on...

           IZZY

Dante is next and not be out done --grabs the wing and folds 
it up even more. 

           DANTE

WRAPS AROUND DANTE --COCOONING HIM IN ITS LEATHERY FABRIC.

Both sides of the bus population rear back -piling up at 
entrances and exits that cannot open.

THEY WATCH DANTE’S BODY STRUGGLE INSIDE THE POWERFUL WING AS 
IF HE WERE TRAPPED INSIDE A GIANT ANACONDA. 

*

Kids banging on both exits. Screaming at the horror of... 

The wing wrapping even tighter and starting to lift him up 
through the split ceiling. Like a hideous curtain, veiling 
with its thin membrane Dante’s entire body. 

Kids can see Dante’s face trying to breathe as it goes up out 
of sight...

Like A Bat Out of Hell: Jeepers Creepers II   2/16/02          78            

Izzy and Double D. charge forward! Almost falling onto it. 
Try wrapping their arms around Dante’s wing-wrapped body!

It quakes violently as they grapple with it. Trying to pull 
him down, yanking harder and harder-- 

--until he slips out of the wing as it disappears back up 
onto the roof and a crimson splatter spraying the ceiling 
overhead...

Izzy and the others crash to their knees with rescued Dante. 
Until they realize something is horribly wrong.

They back away, leaving Dante kneeling on the bus floor -
without his head. Arms still moving as he falls forward. 

EXT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

The Creeper kneeling on top of the bus. In the deep 
indentation of the roof. Rips at his shirt... 

CU ANGLE TILTING UP THE CREEPER                   : 

The tearing cloth reveals his reptilian stomach -and 
something enormously large sliding down its gullet. Dante’s 
eyes, nose and chin outlined in the grayish skin as it moves 
down the throat.

TILT UP FROM THIS TO REVEAL                : The Creeper’s horribly mangled 
head.

The lower half barely able to harbor the gaping mouth that 
smacks its lips having just ingested this human head.

The Creeper stands now. Its tentacles opening---

INT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Jake tearing at the cloth ropes on the back exit as others 
help him.

While boys on the other end of the bus slam against the doors 
with all their might. Double D. scrambling for Dante’s flare 
gun. Fishing for the flares in the headless body’s pockets. 

EXT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

360 AROUND THE CREEPER             :

The Creeper stands. Its tattered clothes fall to its feet. 
His wings unfurled. As he grapples his badly damaged head 
with both hands and tears it off its shoulders with A 
HORRIBLE WAIL.

The Creeper’s head is only attached to the tentacle plate by 
some gummy strings of goo -they finally snap off...

Leaving an empty shell where only its tentacles remain.

The Creeper’s head hits the asphalt as kids inside watch this 
-still frantically pounding away.

EXT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Tentacles that reach down inside the half skull and pull up 
the Creeper’s new head.

Dante’s. 

His own pinkish skin cradled in place by the tentacles --as 
it assimilates into the grayish tone of the Creeper’s 
wrinkled flesh.

INT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Chelsea and others trying to peek up through the split roof 
to see -when GLOOP!!! A slimy glob of something falls onto 
the girl’s face.

She freaks.

Other stare up -just catching a glimpse of the Creeper 
launching into the air from the top of the bus.

Just as THONG!!  Jake gets the last of the lashings off the 
rear exit and it swings open -revealing the idling pick-up 
truck.

All kids staring out at it. Wondering if in this silence they 
should--

Braddock blasts towards the back exit and lurches onto the 
asphalt.

EXT. BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Before he can take two steps toward the truck, Double D., 
Kimball and others follow.

A mass exodus of the bus begins. Attention on the sky, the 
kids storm the old pick-up. Jake overtakes Braddock and they 
struggle at the driver’s door. 

Jake leaps up into the driver seat but is dragged out by 
Braddock. Braddock lurches up to the seat but is pulled down 
by Jake.

Jake leaps up into the driverseat but Braddock drags him out-
as Kimball and Double D. rush up. Kimball slides behind the 
wheel...

Braddock won’t have this. Drags Kimball out of the driver 
seat.

Double D. lunges at Braddock for this --both rolling on the 
asphalt as Kimball tears Braddock off his buddy.

In the meantime Bucky jumps behind the wheel while others 
have already crammed into the passenger side.

Way too many people. Some fight being yanked out. Others 
still pressing.

Kids hang out the doors and off the sides as Bucky lurches it 
forward. Some can’t hold on, hit the asphalt hard.

Bucky guns the engine as Braddock grabs him through the 
window. Will not let him steer. 

Bucky just picks up speed. The truck sways erratically toward 
the back of the bus. Braddock has to let go because--

KA-BASHHH!! THE TRUCK RAMS THE BUS’ REAR AND HARD.

INT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

CLONG!!  Chelsea helping Jonny down the aisle. The impact 
send all the kids rolling.

EXT. BUS. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Bucky throws the truck in reverse. The back door of the bus 
clangs noisily to the asphalt. 

Bucky swerves around the bus --across the yellow line boys 
running from nowhere directly in his way. 

Including Kimball who circled around the bus --WHAM!! Bucky 
hits him hard -Kimball goes right up onto the windshield. 

Bucky swerves across the two-lane as Kimball’s body falls to 
the ground. 

Double D, races to Kimball. Kneels to him. Screams as 
Braddock and many others race after the truck. Chelsea almost 
falling down the bus steps to join them.

One boy grabbing the tailgate and letting the truck drag him 
as it races away.

AREAL VIEW/CREEPER POV             : The pick-up racing away from the 
pandemonium. Not so much noise up here. The quiet of an 
evening wind until A HORRIBLE WAIL CUTS THROUGH THE NIGHT. 

Everyone running after the truck stop and look skyward... 

Double D. looks up slowly from Kimball’s lifeless body.

The Creeper is in front of the moon. In full glory. Wings 
rising and falling silently as it looks down at him.... 

And then dives...

ANGLE SWOOPING DOWN TOWARD EARTH                   : As the kids flee off the 
road and across the field, we are dive bombing them.

           IZZY
    Ruuuunnnnnn!!!!!!

The Creeper sweeping in from above, like a crop duster, 
lowering to snatching level.

Boys and girls running. Some dive and crawl under the bus. 
Others dash into the field but there is no where to hide. The 
field is so big there is no place to hide....

FWOOOSSSHHHHH!!!!!! The Creeper rockets over Izzy’s head and 
on toward Double D.!

Double D. running like his heart will burst out of his chest. 

           IZZY
    HE’S RIGHT BEHIND YOU, D.!! 

POV OF SWOOPING CREEPER             : 

Swooping after Double D.  The kid reaches down, struggles for 
the flare gun -the barrel stuck deep in his pants pocket.

THE CREEPER ALMOST UPON HIM. CAN HEAR THE WINGS FLAPPING THEY 
ARE SO CLOSE---

The Creeper’s mouth opens and A HORRIBLE WAIL COMES OUT. 

Double D. whipping out the flare gun just as he missteps. 
Falls. Goes down hard and quick.

SHH-WOONK!!! The Creeper flies right over him, talons 
reaching out but missing him...

Double D. still rolling in the grass. 

The demon swings up into the air still sailing forward but 
looking back at Double D. and wailing again -this time out of 
frustration.

ANGLE FLYING AWAY FROM DOUBLE D.

Double D. looking up and over- at the Creeper’s other 
intended: Jake still sprinting toward the horizon.

The Creeper sets his sites and dives again.

It looks like the 100 Yard Dash -only for life and death-- 
Jake in the lead with Braddock just behind.

Braddock racing like there will be no tomorrow --and there 
might not-- the Creeper rockets over his head.

Looking back as if a quick scent of something has him 
reassessing Braddock.

Then he is soaring on toward the only target left: Jake still 
out in front as he sprints for his life. 

    JAKE!!!!

           IZZY

THE CREEPER SWOOPS IN RIGHT ON TARGET AND THE BIG STRONG KID 
IS LIFTED RIGHT OFF HIS FEET -SCREAMING AS THE CREEPER’S 
TALONS SINK INTO HIM----

DOLLEY SHOT W/CREEPER/             JAKE CONTINUES: Jake still running as 
he screams --lifted off the ground and launched into the air 
in the clutches of the Creeper.

    JAKE!!!

Observers everywhere stop. Breathless. 

JAKE POV AS HE IS LIFTED INTO THE AIR: Jake streaking away 
from the ground. Izzy leaps on him but can’t hold on. Drops 
off as Jake leaves behind the astonished and the horrified. 
Staring up as they get smaller and smaller. 

ON JAKE: Jake looking up in great pain at his captor. Wings 
flapping, throwing shadow on and off the horrible visage of 
the Creeper.

Though in the rising and falling shadow, the Creeper’s 
silhouette does in fact look like: 

           JAKE
       (horrified)
    Dante?

It looks down at him with Dante’s face surrounded by those 
tentacles -THEY FLY OPEN AND IT WAILS AT HIM.

In pain and horror Jake screams back at it.

Both Taggart and son know this sound all to well. They look 
at the animal baying up at the sky and Taggart hops out with 
his shotgun.

Dad moves to the side of the truck and pets the dogs head 
while scanning the moonlit clouds.

    Daddy!

            JACK JR.

The boy is staring ahead where someone darts across the two-
lane in the distance. 

Taggart watches as the figure runs back to the center of the 
road and stares down at the headlights.

This is a kid. And sprinting now toward the truck!  

BUTCH STOPS HOWLING AND STARTS BARKING LIKE CRAZY AT THE 
APPROACHING RUNNER.

Taggart steps onto the running board of the truck and Jack 
Jr. Rolls toward them. Meeting them half way down the lane.  

Minxie breathless.

She stares at Jack Taggart and his son like they are 
salvation. No words. Just staring. 

THEN BUTCH BARKS WILDLY and Minxie crams into the truck cab 
while Taggart and son look at each other.

    And no fucking farm.

Both turn now and crawl back through the grass beneath the 
single massive oak that shadows them in this large field. 

Part of a group huddled together. Izzy, Rhonda, Chelsea and 
Braddock - cuts and swollen eyes from the fist fight at the 
truck.

    when it flew past you back 
    there? It did it again. That 
    means it looked at you 
    twice. 
       (looks him in the eye)
    So you keep your little 
    blacklist, just know that 
    I’m the one getting the Hell 
    away from you. 

    ‘Cause when he takes you out 
    -and I hope he does? I wanna 
    be as far away from your 
    sorry ass as I can.

Double D. starts walking.

           BRADDOCK
    This is about staying alive, 
    man.
       (off Double D. glare)
    Look, I’m sorry Double D.

           IZZY
    You are so right about that.

Izzy moves after Double D. 

           RHONDA
    You’re really gonna let them 
    go?

           BRADDOCK
    Why, you wanna go with them?

Rhonda stares, sad and shocked at him.

    We coulda’ protected him 
    maybe. We coulda’ protected 
    all of us. If we stuck 
    together. 

Rhonda starts moving off too. 

            RHONDA
    You know like a team?

She joins the twosome that moves away as Braddock looks on. 

EXT. SCHOOL BUS. NIGHT.

Backlit now by approaching headlights, the school bus sits 
even more distressed across the glass sprinkled two-lane.

Jack Jr. stops. Surveys the scene from behind the wheel as he 
blasts a spotlight forward.

BUTCH STARTS TO HOWL AGAIN. A TERRIBLE ERIE SOUND THAT MAKES 
TAGGART LOOK AT HIS SON.

Taggart gets out. Stopped by Minxie’s soft words.

           MINXIE
    You won’t be able to kill 
    it.

Taggart looks at her. THE DOG HOWLS AGAIN.

           MINXIE
    Doesn’t matter what you do 
    to it, it’ll still come 
    back. 

ANOTHER HOWL MAKES THIS EVEN MORE CHILLING.

Taggart’s expression reveals nothing. He might take her for 
crazy. Impossible to tell as he hops up in the back of the 
pick-up. Moves into the freshly welded pulpit.

THE DOG WHINES A LITTLE.  

Taggart scans the night sky and slowly reaches down. 

Lifts a leather strap. Throws it over his shoulder. Straps 
himself to the pulpit with it.

Looks at Jack Jr. and nods him forward. The Taggart pick-up 
rolls toward the bus. 

On the pulpit, Taggart has a searchlight of his own. It finds 
the concaved roof of the bus and its smashed rear.

                                (CONTINUED)

Like A Bat Out of Hell: Jeepers Creepers II   2/16/02          89            

Jack Jr. slams on the brakes quickly. Works his spotlight to 
reveal: Kimball’s body in the middle of the road. Face down. 
Hair blowing in the night breeze.

Minxie lowers her eyes. Won’t look. 

Taggart motions for Jack Jr. to go around. 

RAKING ANGLE TOWARD SIDE OF THE BUS AS TRUCK GOES BEHIND IT                                      :

The pick-up rolls onto the shoulder as the searchlight blasts 
through its broken windows.

A figure appears suddenly in one. 

Taggart swings around swiftly in the pulpit. MAKING A RUSTY, 
SCRAPING SOUND. 

Jonny Young stares back into the glare of the spotlights.  
Battered but alive. Stares with wide eyes at the vicious 
homemade harpoon pointing up at him.

From the small cannon attached to the pulpit. A cannon 
fashioned out of the post puncher mechanism from the Taggart 
farm.

Taggart stares down at the frightened boy from the sites of 
this crudely fashioned weapon. 

            TAGGART
       (lowering his sites)
    You alright?

            MINXIE
    His name is Jonny.

            TAGGART
    Jonny you alright?

Jonny nods his head. Taggart calls down to Minxie.

           TAGGART
    Which way did the rest head 
    off?

           MINXIE
    Everywhere. The truck went 
    that away.

Taggart stares down the dark two-lane. 

EXT. CEMENT FACTORY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Rhonda, Izzy and Double D. stop at a long, much weathered 
cyclone fence. But it is what they see past it that gets 
their attention:

Two dark silos stretch high into the night sky. Flanking 
smaller, flatter buildings in this gloomy abandoned compound. 
Faded legends on them: 
 Kissel Rock and Gravel
            DOUBLE D.
    I don’t believe it, we found 
    some place.

            RHONDA
    Yeah, no place. 

            IZZY
    Maybe we should hold out for 
    some place scarier. You 
    know, more dead looking? I’m 
    sure we could find it if we 
    really put our minds to it.

Double D. spots something now. 

    Fuck.

            DOUBLE D.

Stares ahead through the mesh of the fence at the pick-up 
parked in the distant shadows between the two silos.

This is the truck that raced away from the bus. Once filled 
beyond capacity with escapees and now empty. 

            DOUBLE D.
    Is that the truck I think it 
    is?

    Oh my God!

            RHONDA

Double D. jumps on the fence and starts to scale it. Izzy 
joins him. 

EXT. CEMENT FACTORY. SILO AREA. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

ANGLE FROM BEHIND THE TOP OF ONE SILO                       :

The two boys scale the fence and Rhonda follows. At this 
distance their voices slap echo off the concrete city ahead 
of them. 

           DOUBLE D.
    If that’s them they didn’t 
    get very far. 

The three hop down on the other side of the fence. Make their 
cautious way across the overgrown field.

What the fuck are they doing 
here? They were s’possed to 
go get help...

RHONDA
Maybe they had to go for 
cover.

Slowing now. Can see it is empty and badly damaged.

DOUBLE D.
    If they did I have a feeling 
they never made it.

What remains of the driver’s window is shattered and the door 
has a vicious deep scrape across it. The hood is buckled and 
a hideous hole has been ripped right over the driver seat. 

DOUBLE D.
       (peers in the window)
    Keys are in it.

Looks back at Izzy just as his hand reaches out and pulls at 
Double D.’s shirt. Can barely get out a whisper.

IZZY
    Sweet Jesus God Howdy-do...

Rhonda and Double D. turn to see:

The Ice Cream truck parked back in the deep shadows beyond 
the pick-up. 

RHONDA
    What in the fuck....

A MURDER OF CROWS VAULTS OFF THE DOME OF THE CLOSEST SILO AND 
FLUTTER INTO THE NIGHT.

Double D. has drawn his flare gun. Startled they stare up     
--watching the birds disperse against the moonlit clouds. 

           RHONDA
    We gotta get the Hell outta 
    here.

Suddenly they are in shadow. A great vast shadow, that climbs 
the silo almost swallowing it and vanishes again.

They all whirl around. Up at the distant moon. Has something 
just crossed it?

           IZZY
    No we gotta get the Hell 
    inside.

Double D. is already on his way to the nearest silo door. 

He tries it as quietly as possible. Then leans against it 
with all his weight. Can hear rotting wood start to give way.

KEEE-RAAAAA.... More rotting wood crumbling. The door is 
bending in now...

The giant shadow wings across the yard in the other direction 
now.

The other two, inspired by this to help push against the 
door. Eyes skyward. 

INT. CEMENT FACTORY SILO. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

THUNK!!  The door flies open. Moonlight floods into total 
darkness. 

Double D.’s silhouette fills the doorway then Izzy and Rhonda 
as they crowd in and close the door behind them.

Silence for a long moment. Waiting to hear. Tiny whispers.

           RHONDA
    What is that smell?

           IZZY
    Jesus look up.

The top of the dome has a gaping hole. You can see through it 
into the night sky. Moonlight raking in.

    Minxie remember? A big 
    cement tunnel?
       (off their looks)

Izzy checks himself. He remembers what she said now.

    Oh Christ. A big cement 
    tunnel where it stored all 
    its-

A sudden flutter of great wings and it perches on the dome 
high above them. Staring in the gaping hole.

The four kids back against the wall. Holding their breath. 
Trickles of dust and dirt fall from high above...

Rhonda grabs Izzy’s hand. Holds it tight. Izzy might almost 
grab Double D.’s but curls it into a fist instead. 

To his surprise, Double D. grabs his fist. Holds it.

THE LARGE WINGS FLAP AGAIN AS THE CREEPER LEAPS BACK INTO THE 
SKY -BUT NOT BEFORE DROPPING SOMETHING.

Something large. Plummeting the length of the silo. Coming 
straight at them.

The kids flail back to get away from it as- 

WHAM! It slams brutally onto the silo floor. Rolls right up 
to their feet. It has an arm. Double D. kicks it away in a 
horrible frenzy. 

            DOUBLE D.
    What the fuck was that?

           RHONDA

    Whatever it is, it’s moving.

           IZZY
    Moving right fucking at us--

Izzy screams. Something has his pant leg. And in a sliver of 
moonlight -all can see that is a pale and bloodied Braddock. 
Clutching Izzy’s leg. Shirt gone, pants ragged. 

           RHONDA
       (can barely get the words out)
    Scotty...

She falls to her knees, staring into his eyes. Braddock’s 
mouth opens but no words come out. 

Double D. Caught in a horrible stare with Scott. Not even 
seeing what Izzy is seeing as his eyes adjust even more.

           IZZY
    Oh Jesus...

The silo floor is littered with bodies. Some wrapped, roped, 
and stacked, others not like the more recent acquisitions of 
Coach Hanna and Bus Driver Betty.

death-like stare.

           IZZY
       (in his own daze)
    D’? D’ are you seeing this? 

But Double D. is transfixed on Braddock. And the open hole at 
the small of his back -where something has been removed.  

    Come on...

           IZZY

But Rhonda doesn’t move. Braddock either. Caught staring at 
Braddock’s chalky face as it stares up...

Izzy noticing now that even the silo walls are lined with 
hanging bodies. Watches as one of them, Coach Barnes, is hit 
by another trickle of dust from far above.

Izzy wants to look up. Does so slowly he hopes it won’t be 
noticed. At the top of the dome, --the Creeper slowly edges 
up to the hole and peers down.

           IZZY
    COME ON!!!!! 

Izzy and races out of the silo as Rhonda and Double D. Look 
up.

The hole in the top of the dome is filled with movement as 
they see the Creeper leaping down the length of the silo 
toward them -its wings opening up to soften his landing...  

The Creature hits the floor just as Rhonda and Double D. race 
out the door.

EXT. CEMENT FACTORY. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

The three kids sprint toward the pick-up truck. Izzy is the 
first inside. Turning the key madly as Rhonda and Double D. 
squeeze into the cab next to him.

    You see him?!

           DOUBLE D.

Izzy gets the engine started just as the Creeper crouches and 
leaps from the ground directly at the truck.

The old truck blasts away just as the Creeper comes down. It 
leaps again -this time directly into the back of the truck. 

Double D. Takes his flare gun out and hangs out the passenger 
window trying to get a shot at him... 

CLICK... the gun doesn’t fire. Double D. Panics and aims 
again as the Creature advances toward him--

SKEE--EEOOOSSSHHHH!!!  SOMETHING ROCKETS INTO THE CREEPER SO 
FAST AND SO HARD -IT SENDS IT FLYING OUT OF THE TRUCK INTO 
THE AIR IN A WHIRLING MASS OF WINGS AND LIMBS!

Double D. cannot believe his eyes! Looks down at the flare 
gun --he didn’t even fire it! 

The Creeper somersaults higher and higher until THWONK!!! The 
cable that is now attached to it runs out of slack abruptly 
halting it.

THE CREEPER WAILS. Looking down with wide eyes at ONE OF 
TAGGART’S HOMEMADE HARPOONS THAT HAS SKEWERED HIM THROUGH THE 
STOMACH! 

A long cable attached to the spear leads back to:

The Taggart truck blasting across the field from the two-
lane! Taggart in the truck bed strapped to his post puncher. 
Taking up the slack on the cable by turning a large hand 
crank at its spool. 

The truck smashes through the plant’s cyclone fence and into 
the yard. Braking to a halt with a determined Jack Jr.behind 
the wheel. Minxie, Jonny and the dog crammed in there with 
him. 

The Creeper doesn’t know what to make of it. Soars to a 
higher altitude still tethered. 

Izzy, Rhonda and Double D. screech to a halt at the far end 
of the lot. Staring at the impossibility of a crazy man in a 
pick-up truck who has just harpooned this Creature!

The Creature grabs the metal spear and yanks on it. Glares 
down the cable at the distant truck and takes off higher into 
the sky...

The hand crank spins as cable flies off the spool again. 
Until it runs out. Knotted at the end to stay there.

The Creeper’s ascension is again abruptly stopped. 

IT WAILS DOWN AT THEM -TALONS CLUTCHING THE HARPOON. TAKES 
OFF AGAIN TO FLY HIGHER.

to ascend. 

Jack Jr. standing on the brake but the vehicle is still 
dragged in small juts across the earth. 

Minxie and Jonny clutching the dash. Taggart rocking in his 
harness.

Watching the Creeper soar horizontally now. Back and forth. 
It looks like some demonic kite, tethered by the cable as it 
streaks across the moonlit sky.

Taggart trying to reel him in again. The handle won’t turn 
easily. Then not at all.

The Creeper WAILS wings flapping as it hovers -a tiny distant 
speck at the end of the cable.

Rhonda, Double D. and Izzy in the other truck -watching the 
sky through the hole in the roof.

ANOTHER WAIL and the distant cable slackens. Taggart can see it 
dropping down -and knows in a heartbeat what is coming.

    THERE!!!

The homemade harpoon rockets back at them. 

Minxie leaps out of the cab as Jack Jr., drags the dog out 
his side! Taggart struggling to unhook himself from the 
harness. 

Jonny struggling to move himself. Jack Jr. pulls hard on him, 
drags him out the driverside just as--

--KEE-RASSHHHHH!!!! THE SPEAR PIERCES THE WINDSHIELD AND 
STABS ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE BACK SEAT.

Jonny and Jack Jr. hit the ground hard. Taggart stumbles back

NIGHT... Taggart stares skyward as:

Taggart scrambling for another harpoon. 

The Creeper’s wings narrowed at his sides. It is like a 
missile. 

Taggart slides the spear into the cannon. It will only go in

The Creeper spearheading toward the old pick-up. 

Taggart panicking. Drags the harpoon out. Grabs another one.

Taggart slides the new spear into the cannon.

The Creeper’s face opens WAILING its attack.

CLANK!! Taggart clips the cable from the new spool to the 
spear.

Can see those horrible eyes taking a bead on him--

Taggart swings the cannon up and KEE-OOOSHHHH!!!! The harpoon 
fires.

THA-WACKKK!!! THE CREEPER TAKES THIS ONE HEAD ON AND IT HURLS

The cable unspools wildly from the pulpit! The Creeper a 
tumbling tangle of limbs and wings until--

KA-BLAM! THE CREATURE SLAMS AGAINST THE SILO WALL, HIGH ABOVE

Pieces of concrete crumbling and falling it hits so hard.

Like A Bat Out of Hell: Jeepers Creepers II   2/16/02          99            

            IZZY
    MINXIE, COME ON!

Jack Jr. rolls the Taggart truck toward the silo as his dad 
shoves another spear into the post puncher. 

Taggart takes a bead. The WAILING Creeper just pulling the 
last agonizing foot of harpoon out of its flesh.

KEE-OOOSHHHH!!!!  The harpoon sails out of the canon. Rocks 
the pick-up as it launches toward the silo.

The Creeper pulls the spear free of his chest. WAILS LOUDLY 
JUST AS--

KA-RACKKK!!! THE SECOND ONE GETS HIM DEAD CENTER AGAIN. SENDS 
HIM BLASTING THROUGH THE WALL OF THE SILO AND PLUMMETING 
INSIDE.

The cable falling with it. The crank of the spool spins 
wildly and then stops abruptly with A LARGE THUD FROM INSIDE.

The Creeper has hit bottom and hard.

Jack Jr. brakes again. Leaps out of the cab. Dad is slumped 
over the pulpit. Is he hurt or sobbing? He unsnaps his 
harness and slides to the bottom of the truck bed. 

Izzy revs the engine of the battered pick-up. Double D. In 
the truck bed tending to Jonny.

    Minxie!!!

           DOUBLE D.

But Minxie’s expression is blank. She is staring at the hole 
in the silo and the cable that runs into it.

That cable is moving ever so slightly.

           MINXIE
       (calls across to Taggart)
    I told you, it doesn’t 
    matter what you do to it! 

Taggart looks over at her. 

           MINXIE
    Its eating.

THE DOG HOWLS FROM A FAR CORNER OF THE YARD.

           MINXIE
    It’ll always come back. 
    Twenty-three years from now. 
    And then twenty-three years 
    from then.

                                (CONTINUED)

Like A Bat Out of Hell: Jeepers Creepers II   2/16/02          100            

Taggart looks at her. 

            MINXIE
    You can’t stop it.

The cable snaps to the top of the hole in the silo wall -and 
keeps going. Slicing through the old stone on its way toward 
the dome.

    GO IZZY!

    Minxie!

            DOUBLE D.

           IZZY

           MINXIE
       (shouting)
    It doesn’t matter!!!

The cable cutting upward through the stone until--

BASSSHHH!!! THE CREEPER ERUPTS FROM THE TOP OF THE SILO -
PIECES OF DOME FLYING AS IT SOARS INTO THE SKY HIGH ABOVE THE 
TRUCK.

Izzy’s not waiting anymore -he gases the engine and they 
lurch toward the two-lane.

The cable flying off the spool as the Creeper rockets over and 
past him -after the fleeing pick-up. 

           TAGGART
    JACKY GET BACK!!!!

The Creeper closes it eyes, stretches its arms out and-

KARR-RANNGGG!!! THE CABLE RUNS OUT AND THE TAGGART TRUCK IS 
RIPPED BY A JOLT SO POWERFUL IT FLIPS OVER AND ROLLS!

KA-RANG KA-RANG!  Jack Jr. and Minxie watch in horror. Jonny 
and Double D. in the pick-up bed, see it still rolling as 
they blast onto the two-lane. 

A HIDEOUS WAIL FROM ABOVE AND THE HARPOON THAT WAS IN THE 
CREEPER CLANGS NOISILY ONTO THE ASPHALT--

INT. PICK-UP. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Izzy is one panicked looking driver. Petal to the metal. 
Rhonda in the cab with him.

EXT. PICK-UP TRUCK. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

In the truck bed, Jonny and Double D. stare back at the road 
behind them.

            DOUBLE D. 
(leans down to Izzy)
    Come on man! We’re sitting 
    ducks back here!!

IZZY
       (hollers back)
    I have the pedal to the 
    metal! 

Jonny grabs Double D.’s pant leg. Whirls him around. The dark 
road behind them. Looks empty at first. 

Then something flies in and out of a pool of light of a 
passing billboard.

The Creeper is swooping down the two-lane at car level -in 
hot pursuit of them.

           DOUBLE D.
       (banging on the cab window)
    Go-go-go-go!

INT. PICK-UP TRUCK. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Izzy floors it. The truck moves even faster as he stares in 
the rearview.

EXT. PICK-UP TRUCK. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

The Creeper is gaining on them. 

The boys in back banging on the cab window as they scream. 

           DOUBLE D.
    Move this fucker!!!

ANGLE CHASING THE PICK-UP: Double D. and Jonny in the truck 
bed scream and bang on the cab as we move in on them at a 
dizzying speed. 

INT. PICK-UP TRUCK. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Izzy checks the rearview.

EXT. PICK-UP TRUCK. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

The Creeper gaining. Wings working frantically. Bringing it 
only yards away from the back of the truck. 

The kids flattened against the cab window. Double D. draws 
his flare gun. Tries to level it and keep balance.

It looks down at him --Horrible eyes glinting above that 
wicked toothy grin. 

                                (CONTINUED)

Like A Bat Out of Hell: Jeepers Creepers II   2/16/02          102            

            DOUBLE D.
    DO SOMETHING!!!!

INT. PICK-UP TRUCK. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Izzy completely panicked. Watching in the rearview. 

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

The Creeper is coming in over the tailgate now -at snatching 
level.

FWWWIZZZZZZ!!!!! Double D.fires the flare gun. But his aim is 
shaky and the red comet easily dodged by the Creeper this 
time.

           DOUBLE D.
    IZZY - DO SOMETHING!!!!

INT. PICK-UP TRUCK. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

           IZZY
    GET DOWN!!!

Frantic Izzy turns the wheel sharply. 

EXT. PICK-UP TRUCK. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

CHI-WUNK!!! The truck rocks violently as it leaves the road 
and rockets into an open field.

The kids in the back hit the bed with the impact clutching 
anything they can not to bounce out.

The Creeper loses little distance. Angling after them. 

Double D. bouncing in the back of the truck. Staring back at 
the approaching beast. The boy loses his balance and slides 
to the tailgate.

His feet hit it. Just as WHAM!!! The Creeper’s talons latch 
onto it as well. Starting to pull itself into the truck bed -
right on top of Double D.!

            DOUBLE D.
    IZZEEEEEE!!!!!!!

INT. PICK-UP TRUCK. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Izzy sees all in the rearview. In a frenzied panic:

            IZZY
       (to Rhonda)
    Get out!
       (off her horrified look)
    Get out of the truck!!!

He pushes her against the passenger door. Opens it! Pushes 
her out!!!!

EXT. FIELD. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

Rhonda hits and rolls as the truck leaves her behind...

The Creeper distracted for just a moment then looks ahead and 
puts a talon onto Double D’s shoulder...

           DOUBLE D.
    GODDAMMIT IZZEEEE!!!!!!!

INT. PICK-UP TRUCK. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

           IZZY
    STAY DOWN!!!!

Izzy does the only thing he can think of to spare his friends 
their horrible fate.

He slams on the brakes.

EXT. PICK-UP TRUCK. NIGHT. SAME TIME.

THE CREEPER WAILS --CRASHING INTO THE BACK OF THE CAB WITH 
SUCH FORCE --IT SMASHES INTO THE WINDOW, GOES THRU THE CAB, 
AND EXPLODES OUT THE WINDSHIELD!

The force of this and the terrible speed of the truck trying 
to brake -flips it violently. 

Bodies spilling out of the bed as it rolls several times 
before coming to a horrible, mangled rest upside down deep in 
the field.

Silence. The eerie stillness that comes after terrible 
cacophonies.

A very cut and very shaken Double D. lifts his head. The 
field looks empty.

Then he sees a distant head lifting out of the grass by the 
spilled truck. 

Jonny’s.  Bloodied and bruised. Jonny stares at him in a daze 
and then drops again out of view -and probably unconscious. 

Double D. tries to move toward him. Winces. Looks down at his 
leg. Pant leg torn and bloody. Badly broken.

Looks out at again. Then sees something just a few feet from 
him.

Double D. drags himself to it. His flare gun. Reaches for it.
