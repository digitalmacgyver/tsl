INT. APARTMENT - DAY
The hallway is a mess. A window opening onto a light well is 
open. 

The door to the apartment is suddenly broken open. A plain-
clothes detective, two uniformed police officers and several 
firemen - also in uniform - enter and look around. They all 
wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses. 
Behind them, the superintendent and his wife also push their 
way in. Theyre both holding their noses. In his free hand, 
the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional 
flyers. Behind him, comes a female neighbor. 

             PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
      (to the superintendent and the 
      neighbor)
      Wait Outside please.

He signals to a police officer who herds the curious 
onlookers back out through the door. 

             POLICE OFFICER
      (to the superintendent, pointing to 
      a pile of mail)
      Whats the date of the last letter?

             SUPERINTENDENT
      (verifying)
      The 16th from what I can see... 
      Wait...

The plain-clothes detective has tried in vain to open the 
door on the left. It has been sealed up with adhesive tape. 

             PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE 
      (to the fire officer)
      Can you try?

While the firemen go to work on the door, the plain-clothes 
detective goes into the adjoining dining room. He opens the 
windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via 
the double doors. They are locked and the gaps are also taped 
up. He turns to the right and goes into the living room, 
where he also opens up the windows...

             FIREMAN
	(O.S.)
      The door is open.

...and comes back into the hallway, passing by the waiting 
firemen. Once again, we hear snatches of dialogue between the 
police officer and the janitor.


                                      2.
             JANITOR
      ...no as far as I know. During the 
      whole time, they had a nurse, but 
      its been a while since I last saw 
      her. My wife has been...

The plain-clothes detective enters the bedroom which is now 
accessible. Its windows are open and the draft makes the 
curtains billow into the room.

             PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE
      (to the firemen who are now curious 
      enough to come and stand by the 
      door)
      Did you open the windows?

The firemen shake their heads.

The PLAIN-CLOTHES DETECTIVE turns toward the big double bed 
placed against the back wall of the bedroom. On the right-
hand bed, theres only the bare mattress. On the left-hand 
bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman. Where 
once there were eyes, now there are only gaping holes. The 
corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers 
that have already dried out a little. On her chest is a 
crucifix.

White letters on a black background: THE CREDITS


INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT

All we see is the audience pouring into the hall. GEORGES and 
ANNE, both are around eighty, are part of this crowd. They go 
to their seats in one of the rows near the front. Once 
everybody is seated, we hear the usual ANNOUNCEMENT asking 
people to turn off their mobile phones. Some people, caught 
with their phones switched on, hasten to comply. Then the 
lights go out. APPLAUSE.

Off-screen, we hear the soloist make his entrance. THROATS 
ARE CLEARED here and there. Finally, the MUSIC begins.

INT. ARTISTS DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

The music from Scene 3 continues. The soloist is surrounded 
by admirers who congratulate him.

Now Georges and Anne push their way into the room. (If the 
soloist is female, they will be carrying flowers, like most 
of the others).


                                      3.
When the soloist notices their presence, he leaves his group 
of fans, heads towards them and greets them very warmly, 
visibly glad to see them.

INT. BUS - NIGHT

Continuation of the MUSIC from Scene 3.

Georges and Anne are seated side by side in the half empty 
bus. Anne talks enthusiastically, Georges says something from 
time to time, and smiles now and then. They are both relaxed 
and happy.

INT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT

The door to the apartment is unlocked and opened from the 
outside. THE MUSIC ENDS.

Georges comes in, turns on the light. He and Anne observe the 
open door. Around the lock, one can see the traces of an 
attempted forced entry.

Georges bends down and runs his fingers over the deep 
grooves.

             GEORGES
      They used a screwdriver or 
      something like that...it doesnt 
      look very professional...

             ANNE
      But who would do something like 
      that?

             GEORGES
      No idea. Why do people break in? 
      Because they want to steal 
      something.

             ANNE
      From us?

             GEORGES
      (laughs briefly out loud) 
      Hey, why not? If I thought about 
      it, I could come up with at least 
      three or four people we know whove 
      been burgled.

After having examined the outside of the second leaf of the 
double door, he comes in, closing the door behind him. 


                                      4.
             ANNE
      What time is it? Cant we call the 
      superintendent?

             GEORGES
      Ill do that tomorrow morning. 
      Anyway, they didnt see anything.

He unbuttons his overcoat and heads toward the large closet 
in the hallway. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Dont let it spoil your good mood 
      now. 

             ANNE
      Or the police?

             GEORGES
      Come on, give me your coat.

She goes toward him, he takes her coat off and hangs it with 
his in the closet.

             ANNE
      Imagine if we were here, in our 
      beds, and someone broke in.

             GEORGES
      Why should I imagine that?

             ANNE
      But its terrible! I think Id die 
      of fright.

             GEORGES
      (laughing) 
      So would I.

He undoes his shoes.

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Shall we have a drink?

             ANNE
      Im tired.

             GEORGES
      I still fancy a drink.

He puts away his shoes with the others and slips on his 
slippers. Anne has gone into the bathroom.


                                      5.
             ANNE
	(O.S.)
      Go ahead then. Mathilde told me 
      that in her building, the attic 
      apartment was burgled from the 
      loft. They just knocked a hole in 
      the wall, cut out all of the 
      valuable pictures from their frames 
      and disappeared without a trace.

He goes toward the kitchen.

             GEORGES
      They must have been professionals.

As he passes in front of the bathroom, he stops and appears 
to be looking at Anne.

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Did I tell you, you looked good 
      tonight?

SHORT PAUSE. THEN:

             ANNE
	(O.S.)
      (Flattered) 
      Whats got into you?

With a gentle LAUGH, Georges disappears into the kitchen, 
where he turns on the lights. We hear him FIDDLING AROUND, 
apparently getting a glass and some wine. After a short 
PAUSE:

             ANNE
	(CONTD)
      Werent those semiquavers in the 
      presto incredible? What staccato! 
      Dont you agree?

Short PAUSE.

             GEORGES
	(O.S.)
      Youre proud of him, huh?

SCENE 7 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Georges wakes up. He looks with amazement beside him, then 
raises his eyes. Anne is sitting upright, her back against 
the headboard. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Something wrong?

             ANNE
      No.


                                      6.
After a while, the RINGING of a kitchen egg-timer leads us to 
the next scene.

SCENE 8 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY

The egg timer in the kitchen RINGS.

Georges is seated in front of the window, at a table which is 
half set for breakfast. He has mobile phone raised to his ear 
and a phone book opened in front of him. Anne is getting up 
from the table. She goes toward the stove, turns off the gas, 
takes the egg out of the pan with a spoon and runs it under 
cold water. Like Georges, she is still in her robe.

             GEORGES
      (on the phone) 
      What about next week? No but still, 
      it would make sense to get it done 
      soon. It might give people silly 
      ideas. And anyway, its too ugly to 
      look at... Wednesday? What time? 
      OK... Will you bring the paint with 
      you too, to paint over it? But at 
      least some primer...Yes, OK. Thank 
      you. 

He hangs up.

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      (to Anne)
      You can depend on that guy. 

             ANNE
      (who comes back to the table with 
      the egg) I hope so. The last time, 
      he kept us waiting for ages, if you 
      remember.

             GEORGES
      (laughs while acquiescing) 
      Yes, thats true. (Reacting when 
      she places the egg in his egg cup) 
      Thanks. If I call a regular 
      professional, well still be 
      waiting two months time. 

             ANNE
      (more to herself)
      Really?

She has sat down. Looks straight ahead. He cracks open his 
egg, puts salt on it, eats. 


                                      7.
             GEORGES
      The Frodons waited three days when 
      their toilet was blocked. Not 
      exactly pleasant.

He eats. Wants to put on more salt, but the saltcellar is 
empty. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      The saltcellar is empty.

He looks up for an instant, as if he expected her to deal 
with it. As she doesnt react, he realizes the 
inappropriateness of such an expectation, gets up himself, 
heads for the kitchen cupboards and fills the salt cellar.

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      I dont know if hes going to bring 
      us the CD. Maybe he wont come at 
      all. In any case, he didnt mention 
      it. Id like to buy it. It was 
      really good and I dont want to 
      wait long for it. We could go to 
      Virgin this afternoon and buy it. 
      What do you say?

He comes back to the table and sits down again.

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Hmmm? Anne? Whats the matter?

She looks at him and doesnt answer.

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Whats going on? Whats the matter?

He waves his hand in front of her eyes and laughs nervously. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Helllloooo!!! Cuckoo!!! Im here!

She continues to look at him without reacting.

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      (serious now) Anne! Whats going 
      on?

He waits, looks at her. No reaction. He stands up slightly, 
leans over the table to sit beside her. Tries to make her 
turn toward him. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Anne, whats the matter?


                                      8.
He manages to get her torso to turn halfway toward him, but 
her eyes look through him. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Anne...whats...

He takes her face in both hands and turns toward him.

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Anne...

She stares into the void. He drops his hands. Then sits 
beside her, for quite awhile.

SILENCE

Finally he gets up, heads for the sink, turns on the tap, 
wets a tea towel, wrings it out a little, comes back and 
places it on Annes face. Waits for a reaction that doesnt 
come. Then he pulls up her hair in the nape of her neck and 
applies the cloth there. Then sits down and looks at her 
imploringly.

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      (close to tears) 
      Anne...Darling...please!

Once again they both remain seated. In the background, we 
hear the GUSHING of the tap that in his panic he has 
forgotten to turn it off. 

Making a sudden decision, he gets up, rapidly crossing the 
hallway, he goes into the bedroom where he starts to dress 
agitatedly, which takes him quite a lot of time.  Suddenly, 
the GUSHING of the tap stops, which had accompanied us as far 
as the bedroom. 

George doesnt notice it immediately, then he stops short. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Anne?

Finally he returns, half dressed, into the kitchen. 

Anne is seated in the same place and looks at him.

             ANNE
      What are you doing?

She turns toward the breakfast.

             ANNE
	(CONTD)
      You left the water running. 


                                      9.
Georges stares at her.

             GEORGES
      (both aghast and furious) 
      Hey, whats going on? Are you 
      completely crazy? Is this supposed 
      to be a joke, or whats going on?

She looks at him with amazement.

             ANNE
      What did you say?

             GEORGES 
      (seriously) 
      Is this a joke? Is this meant to be 
      a joke?

             ANNE
      What joke? I dont get it! Why are 
      you talking to me like that? Whats 
      got into you?

Georges comes from the door to the table. 

             GEORGES
      Anne! Please! Stop this game. Its 
      not funny.

             ANNE
      (getting irritated) 
      What game, for Christs sake? What 
      on earths the matter?!!

Georges is about to answer in  a similarly irritated tone, 
but gradually begins to suspect that he could be mistaken. He 
tries to calm down, takes his chair that has remained beside 
Anne, sits down and looks at his wife. She doesnt know how 
to react.

             GEORGES
      Whats the matter? Why didnt you 
      react?

             ANNE
      To what?

             GEORGES
      To what? To me, to everything.

             ANNE
      When?


                                      10.
             GEORGES
      Just now. A moment ago.

             ANNE
      Please tell me whats wrong. What 
      am I supposed to have done?

Georges first looks away reluctantly, then looks at Anne. He 
doesnt want to believe that its serious. 

             GEORGES
      I dont know what to say. Do you 
      really not know what just happened?

             ANNE
      But what DID happen?

             GEORGES
      (almost reluctantly bowing his head 
      as he speaks) You were sitting 
      there, staring at me. You didnt 
      answer me when I asked you what the 
      matter was.

He picks up the wet tea towel from the table.

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      I put this tea towel on your face, 
      and you didnt react.

Anne looks at the towel, then at Georges, and shakes her 
head, perturbed that she cant understand. Georges looks at 
her. He sees the damp marks on the collar of her robe.

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Look... Theres still dampness on 
      your collar.

Anne follows his gesture, tugs on her collar and sees the 
damp marks. She slowly grasps that something is awry.

             ANNE
      When... When was it?

             GEORGES
      Just now, a few minutes ago.

             ANNE
      So...??

             GEORGES
      Theres no So. I went into the 
      bedroom to get dressed. I wanted to 
      get help.


                                      11.
             ANNE
      Help?

             GEORGES
      Yes, and then you turned off the 
      tap.

             ANNE
      Yes. Because you left it on.

SILENCE

PAUSE.

             ANNE
	(CONTD)
      I dont understand.

             GEORGES
      Neither do I.

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Dont you think its best if I call 
      Dr. Bertier?

             ANNE
      Why? What can he do?

             GEORGES
      I dont know. Examine you.

             ANNE
      Im fine. Theres nothing wrong 
      with me.

             GEORGES
      Anne, please!! Thats absurd. We 
      cant pretend that nothing 
      happened.

             ANNE
      But what DID happen?

             ANNE
	(CONTD)
      Im here. Im having my breakfast, 
      and youre telling me things 
      happened that I dont understand.

             GEORGES
      Can you explain how the tea towel 
      got there?

PAUSE.


                                      12.
             ANNE
      (irritated) 
      No, I cant!

             GEORGES
      Who turned on the tap?

             ANNE
      You did!

             GEORGES
      Can you remember that?

             ANNE
      (more and more desperate, close to 
      tears) No I cant! Do you want to 
      torture me? Leave me in peace!

Georges looks at her.

             GEORGES
      Dont you think it would be better 
      to fetch Dr. Bertier?

             ANNE
      No!

She takes her cup of tea, as if to show how well she is, and 
drinks it up. When she wants to re-fill her cup, she 
completely misses her aim. She notices it, puts down her cup 
and bursts into tears.

INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

SILENCE

We see wide shots of the apartment. The hallway. The bedroom. 
The living room. The dining room. The kitchen. Nobody in 
sight.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

EVA, around 50, has come to pay a visit. Anne isnt there.

             EVA
      You know how he is. Once hes got 
      something into his head, he has to 
      go through with it. In the end, 
      everybody was delighted. And 
      besides, it didnt hurt our 
      financial situation. Were playing 
      until the 28th. 
             (MORE)


                                      13.
             EVA
	(CONT'D)
      Then we have 10 days to rest, then 
      we go to Stockholm for four days, 
      and then to Kumo in Finland. Heaven 
      knows where that is. At the North 
      Pole. But Geoffs already been 
      there  few times, and he loves it. 
      Were playing the Dowland 
      Transcriptions there and then 
      were back in London. 

             GEORGES
      What about the children?

             EVA
      Liz is at boarding school and John 
      is living his own life. Hes twenty-
      six years old.

             GEORGES
      What does he do?

             EVA
      Hes a student. We rarely see him. 
      Hes got his own ideas. Life Geoff. 
      They dont really get along. Geoff 
      wants to advise him on everything, 
      and John doesnt like that at all.

             GEORGES
      Is he good?

             EVA
      I think so. Hes less impulsive. 
      Very industrious.

             GEORGES
      That sounds rather derogatory.

             EVA
      No!! Hes not like Geoff. Quiet, 
      but stubborn. I think hell do all 
      right. At the last Conservatory 
      concert, he played the solo part in 
      the Haydn Concerto. It was very 
      good. Geoff was there and 
      congratulated him at the end. 

Brief PAUSE.

             GEORGES
      And you?

             EVA
      What do you mean?


                                      14.
             GEORGES
      Did you both make up?

             EVA
      (with a little laugh) 
      My God, you know him, dont you? 
      Over the winter, he suddenly 
      discovered his passion for a viola 
      player whod been in our ensemble 
      for years. What can I  tell you? It 
      was a huge drama, and the poor 
      little darling wound up trying to 
      commit suicide. That scared him and 
      he came back to me in full remorse. 
      Ive got used to it now. Whats a 
      bit embarrassing is that the 
      ensemble, you cant keep any 
      secrets from anyone.

             GEORGES
      Do you love him?

             EVA
      Yes, I think so.

Brief PAUSE.

             EVA
	(CONTD)
      Whats aphasia?

Georges gestures that its too complicated.

             GEORGES
      What can I say? The carotid artery 
      was blocked. They did an ultrasound 
      scan, two in fact, and they said 
      they had to operate on her. She was 
      scared. She was confused and 
      scared. You know she has always 
      been afraid of doctors. They said 
      the risk was very low and that if 
      they didnt operate, shed be 
      certain to have a serious stroke. 

             EVA
      And what do they say now?

             GEORGES
      Just that it didnt go well. Its 
      one of the 5% that go wrong.

He yawns.


                                      15.
             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Its pretty upsetting.

He looks at his watch.

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Usually at this time, I take a nap. 
      My blood sugar is somewhere down in 
      my socks.

PAUSE.

PAUSE.

             EVA
      Im so sorry.

             GEORGES
      Yeah.

             EVA
      What can I do for you?

             GEORGES
      Nothing. It was nice of you to come 
      despite all of your stress.

Brief PAUSE.

She doesnt know what to say.

PAUSE.

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      No, really. Theres nothing you can 
      do. Well see how things go when 
      shes back here in the apartment. 
      Well manage. Maybe Ill get a 
      caretaker in, or maybe Ill manage 
      on my own. Well see. Weve been 
      through quite a lot in our time, 
      your mother and I. 
      (little laugh) 
      All this is still a bit new.

             EVA
      (with a little laugh) 
      Its funny. I dont know if I 
      should say it. Maybe itll 
      embarrass you. But when I came here 
      a short while ago, I suddenly 
      remembered how I always used to 
      listen to the two of you making 
      love when I was little. 
             (MORE)


             EVA	(CONT'D)
      For me, at the time, it was 
      reassuring. It gave me a feeling 
      that you loved each other, and that 
      wed always be together.

                                      16.

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

A carpenter and his assistant are raising the base of the 
double bed. Georges watches.

INT. HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DAY 

The door of the apartment is opened. Georges comes in. Behind 
him is Anne in a wheelchair, pushed by a paramedic. A second 
paramedic (as young as the first) follows with a suitcase and 
a large bag. Behind them, the superintendent. 

Georges tries to rid of the three as quickly as possible. He 
stuffs a twenty euro note into the hand of the first 
paramedic. 

             GEORGES
      Here. Thank you very much. Its for 
      both of you. You can just put the 
      things down here. There, beside the 
      window, right. Well be okay on our 
      own. Thanks a lot. 

The two paramedics exchange a brief glance, say thanks, and 
leave the apartment, passing the superintendent as they go.

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      (to the superintendent) 
      Thank you, Mr. Mery.

             SUPERINTENDENT
      If you need anything, just call 
      downstairs. If we can help at 
      all...

             GEORGES
      Right now everythings fine. Ill 
      let your wife know as soon as we 
      need anything.

             SUPERINTENDENT
      (to Anne) 
      Its nice to have you back, Mrs. 
      Laurent.

             ANNE
      Yes. Thank you, Mr. Mery. Thank 
      you.


                                      17.
The superintendent hesitates another moment. 

             ANNE
	(CONTD)
      Yes, thanks.

             SUPERINTENDENT
      Yes... So... Goodbye then, maam. 
      Welcome home again. Goodbye, Sir.

             GEORGES
      Goodbye, Mr. Mery.

             SUPERINTENDENT
      Goodbye.

He leaves the apartment. 

There is a brief moment of perplexity. Then Georges says:

             GEORGES
      (with a nervous smile) 
      Where do you want...

             ANNE
      In the living room.

Georges pushes her toward the living room door, walks around 
the wheelchair, opens the door, comes back behind the 
wheelchair and pushes Anne into the LIVING ROOM.

The doorway is narrow. The wheelchair only just passes 
through it. Georges pushes Anne toward the sofa and the 
armchairs and then steps in front of her.

             GEORGES
      Shall I make some tea?

             ANNE
      (with a faint smile) 
      First come sit with me. 

George registers her smile; he knows hes behaving in a 
clumsy way. He sits down in one of the two arm chairs.

             ANNE
	(CONTD)
      Can you help me into the chair?

Georges stands back up.

             GEORGES
      (eagerly) 
      Of course.


                                      18.
He extends his hands. She puts on the wheelchair brake, lifts 
the footrest with her left foot, raises her right leg from 
the footrest with her left hand and then extends her left arm 
to Georges.

             ANNE
      Its best if you put my arm around 
      your neck and your right arm around 
      me, that way itll be easy.

He does as he is told, pulls her up as they hobble together 
the short distance to the second arm chair. Cautiously, he 
lowers her down and helps her sit herself straight. Because 
they are not used to it, the whole process appears awkward 
and clumsy.

             ANNE
	(CONTD)
      Thanks.

He smiles because it seems silly to him to answer Dont 
mention it. Then he sits down opposite her.

LONG PAUSE.

At first they are both ill at ease, but then they accept the 
fact that words do not come easily. After a long while, 
during which we hear the intermittent sound of the TRAFFIC 
below. 

             GEORGES
      (softly almost to himself) 
      Im glad youre back.

             ANNE
      (in a voice just as soft) 
      Me too.

Another PAUSE. Then Anne says:

             ANNE
	(CONTD)
      Promise me one thing. 

             GEORGES
      What?

             ANNE
      Please never take me back to the 
      hospital.

             GEORGES
      What?

PAUSE.


                                      19.
She looks at him. He has understood.

             ANNE
      You promise?

             GEORGES
      Anne...

             ANNE
      You promise?

             GEORGES
      Anne, I...

PAUSE.

             ANNE
      Dont talk right now. And dont 
      give me any lectures. Please.

Brief PAUSE.

             GEORGES
      What can I say, its...

             ANNE
      (interrupting him) 
      Nothing. Just dont say anything. 
      OK?!

PAUSE.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

He helps her into bed, then throws the blanket over her.

             GEORGES
      There.

             ANNE
      Thank you. Thank you, Darling.

             GEORGES
      Everything OK?

             ANNE
      (smiling) 
      Everythings fine.

He hesitates.


                                      20.
He nods.

             ANNE
	(CONTD)
      You dont have to hold my hand all 
      the time now. I can look after 
      myself, you know.

             ANNE
	(CONTD)
      And dont feel guilty. That would 
      be pointless. And a drag. For me 
      too.

             GEORGES
      I dont feel guilty.

             ANNE
      Thats good.

She smiles.

             ANNE
	(CONTD)
      Go over there now. Im not a 
      cripple. You can easily leave me 
      alone for two minutes. I wont 
      collapse.

             GEORGES
      (with a slight smile) 
      OK.

             ANNE
      Did you buy the new book on 
      Harnoncourt?

             GEORGES
      Ive already read it.

             ANNE
      And?

             GEORGES
      Do you want it? Ill get it for 
      you.

             ANNE
      Sure.

He goes out of the room to fetch the book. She remains lying 
there, waiting, and runs her healthy left hand through her 
hair to make herself look prettier, then smooths out the 
blanket that has slipped out of place a little. After a 
while, we hear Georges shouting. 


                                      21.
             GEORGES
	(O.S.)
      I dont know where I put it.

             ANNE
      Dont worry. It isnt that 
      important.

             GEORGES
	(O.S.)
      Yes, it is. Hold on, maybe its in 
      the... Just a moment! Viola! Here 
      you are! Nothing like an infallible 
      memory!

She smiles, looks in his direction. He enters with the book 
in his hand. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      I thought Id left it over there in 
      the other room, but Id already put 
      it away. Tidy people just cant 
      help being tidy.

             ANNE
      (taking the book) 
      Thanks.

She puts the book on her stomach. Looks at Georges.

             ANNE
	(CONTD)
      Right now, take care of yourself. 
      And dont wait to see how I hold 
      the book in my hand, OK?

             GEORGES
      OK.

He looks at her for a moment longer, then leaves the bedroom. 
She waits till hes outside. Tries to relax. Then she 
remembers the book. She takes it in her left hand and tries 
to open it. Its not easy for her.

Then she notices that shes forgotten her glasses. She rests 
the book back on the bed cover and fishes for her glasses on 
the night stand. In the end, she manages it. Then she opens 
the book again, and tries to read.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY  

The superintendents wife puts the filled supermarket bags on 
the counter. Takes the stack of mail that she had put on top 
of one of the bags and puts it down beside them. Then she 
takes out the receipt and the change. 


                                      22.
             SUPERINTENDANTS WIFE 
      Unfortunately the strawberries were 
      already moldy. Ill go and get you 
      some fresh ones tomorrow from the 
      market. My husband will bring you 
      the bottled water this afternoon. 
      I'm not supposed to carry anything 
      heavy: my back, you know... 

             GEORGES 
      Sure, no problem.

             SUPERINTENDENTS WIFE 
      It came to 76 euros and 40 cents. 
      Theres the till receipt and here's 
      your change: 23 euros 60. 

              GEORGES 
      Thank you very much. Keep the 
      change. Thanks. 

              SUPERINTENDENTS WIFE 
      Thank you, sir. 

Short embarrassed PAUSE. 

              SUPERINTENDENTS WIFE
	(CONTD)
      Well, Ill be off. Call me if you 
      need anything else. 

              GEORGES 
      Yes. I will. 

              SUPERINTENDENTS WIFE 
      Is your wife well? ... 

              GEORGES
      Yes, she's OK. Shes recovering. 

             SUPERINTENDENTS WIFE
      Fine. Give her my regards. My 
      husband and I are very glad shes 
      back. 

              GEORGES
      Yes, we are too. Bye, Mrs. Mry, 
      thanks so much. 

              SUPERINTENDENTS WIFE
      Goodbye, sir. 

She heads toward the front door of the apartment, turns 
around again toward Georges.


                                      23.
              SUPERINTENDENTS WIFE
	(CONTD)
      Ill bring you the strawberries 
      tomorrow around noon, if that suits 
      you. 

He nods, she closes the door as she leaves. 

INT. HALLWAY - TOILET - DAY

He stands in front of the closed door of the toilet, waiting. 
After a while, we hear the noise of flushing. After a while 
longer, we hear 

              ANNE
	(O.S.) 
      There. Can you come in, please? 

He opens the toilet door, goes around Anne, pulls her up, she 
puts her left arm around his neck, keeps herself upright that 
way, he pulls up her pants under her skirt. Then they slowly 
hobble out of the toilet and he sits her back down in the 
wheelchair. 

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

They are both lying in their beds. Anne sleeps, BREATHING 
NOISILY. Georges lies with his eyes open, listening 
attentively to her breathing. 

INT. KITCHEN - DAY   

The sun shines in. Georges has cooked something simple. They 
are both in a good mood, eating and drinking. 

             GEORGES 
      ... some banal romance or other 
      about a nobleman and a lower middle-
      class girl who couldnt have each 
      other and who then, out of sheer 
      magnanimity, decide to renounce 
      their love - in fact I don't quite 
      remember it any more. In any case, 
      afterwards I was thoroughly 
      distraught, and it took me a bit of 
      time to calm down. In the courtyard 
      of the house where grandma lived, 
      there was a young guy at the window 
      who asked me where Id been. He was 
      a couple of years older than me, a 
      braggart who of course really 
      impressed me. To the movies, I 
      said, because I was proud that my 
      grandma had given me the money to 
      go all alone to the cinema.  
             (MORE)


                                      24.
             GEORGES 
	(CONT'D)
      What did you see? I started to 
      tell him the story of the movie, 
      and as I did, all the emotion came 
      back. I didn't want to cry in front 
      of the boy, but it was impossible; 
      there I was, crying out loud in the 
      courtyard, and I told him the whole 
      drama to the bitter end. 

              ANNE 
      So? How did he react? 

             GEORGES
      No idea. He probably found it 
      amusing. I don't remember. I don't 
      remember the film either. But I 
      remember the feeling. That I was 
      ashamed of crying, but that telling 
      him the story made all my feelings 
      and tears come back, almost more 
      powerfully than when I was actually 
      watching the film, and that I just 
      couldn't stop. 

She looks at him, smiles, then turns back to her food. 

              ANNE 
      That's cute. Why didn't you ever 
      tell me before? 

              GEORGES
      There are still a few stories you 
      don't know. 

             ANNE 
       Aha...? Dont tell me youre going 
      to ruin your image in your old age? 

              GEORGES
      (grinning) 
      You bet I wont. But what is my 
      image? 

She takes a mouthful, eats ponderously. Then she looks at 
him. 

              ANNE 
      (tenderly)
      Sometimes youre a rotter. But 
      youre nice. 

              GEORGES 
      (embarrassed grin) 
      Can I take you for a drink? 


                                      25.
She laughs. 

INT. HALLWAY - DAY 

He does physiotherapy exercises with her. Counts the 
repetitive movements of the exercises. 

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY  

Shes lying on the sofa. Hes seated in the armchair. Theyre 
both reading the newspaper. After a while: 

             ANNE
      Listen to this! My horoscope. 
      Motto: You have lots of verve, but 
      need to be more serious! 
      Love: High-class conversation is 
      what you need. 
      Work: Youre motivated again. But 
      proceed with care. 
      Health: Loosen up by doing 
      exercises. Itll give you renewed 
      pizzazz. 

PAUSE. Then

              GEORGES 
      (good-humored)
      You've only yourself to blame if 
      you read stuff like that. 

Brief PAUSE. Then: 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Tomorrow afternoon is Pierre's 
      funeral. 

              ANNE
      You have to go. 

              GEORGES
      I fear I must. I don't want to go 
      at all.

              ANNE
      Who does like going to funerals? 

             GEORGES
      Oh, I know a few people who do. 
      Annette can never wait to get all 
      dolled up again. And Franois 
      has... 


                                      26.
              ANNE
      Youre mean. What would you say if 
      no one came to your funeral? 

              GEORGES 
      (dryly) Nothing, presumably. 

She shoots him a glance, smiles at his irony. Then she says: 

             ANNE
      Have you talked to Jeanne since I 
      was in the hospital? I mean, does 
      she know I cant come? 

              GEORGES
      Of course. 

              ANNE
      What did she say? 

              GEORGES
       She was shocked. 

              ANNE
      How?

             GEORGES 
      (a bit irritated)
      My God, what are people like when 
      they're shocked? She couldnt 
      believe it, she was speechless. I 
      don't remember any more. In any 
      case, not exactly. Ive spoken to a 
      lot of people since.

PAUSE. 

              ANNE
      Sorry. 

             GEORGES
      No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be 
      unkind, but I just dont see the 
      point of talking about it all the 
      time. 

Short PAUSE. 

             ANNE
      Do I talk about it all the time? 


                                      27.
              GEORGES
      No. Sorry. 

              ANNE
      Don't worry. 

INT. HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DAY   

The front door is unlocked from the outside, and Georges 
enters. Hes back from the funeral, dressed for the occasion. 
He turns on the light. Hes wet. Clearly, its been raining. 
As he closes the door again, his eyes fall on Anne. With her 
back to him, she is sitting on the floor in front of the 
opened window of the light well, half propped against her 
wheelchair.

               GEORGES
      What ... ?!

Shaken, he heads toward her, picks her up and seats her in 
the wheelchair. Outside, in the light well, it is raining. 

PAUSE. 

PAUSE. 

             ANNE 
      (once shes seated in the 
      wheelchair)
      Why are you back already? What time 
      is it? 

Georges has understood immediately. He closes the window 
noiselessly. 

Then just stands there, at a loss. 

SILENCE. Then

              ANNE
	(CONTD)
      (softly) 
      Forgive me, I was too slow. 

              GEORGES
      Anne... 

              ANNE
      Can you wheel me into the living 
      room? 

PAUSE.

              GEORGES
      Yes. 


He turns toward her, pushes the wheelchair into the living room between the two armchairs. Turns on the light. Stops 
beside the switch. They both look exhausted. 

                                      28.

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      You're always good at surprises. 

              ANNE
      Yes. Why are you home earlier? 

             GEORGES
      I didn't come home earlier. I took 
      a taxi. In August, there isnt a 
      lot of traffic. 

              ANNE
      Thats true. How was the funeral? 

              GEORGES
      Anne...! 

             ANNE
      How was it, go on, tell me! 

He thinks an instant, then goes and sits down facing her in 
an armchair. Looks at her. She raises her head and returns 
his look. He understands that he can't insist right now. Long 
PAUSE. Then he begins: 

             GEORGES
      It was rather bizarre. The priest 
      was an idiot. Then one of Pierres 
      co-workers made a speech that was 
      embarrassingly emotional. His old 
      secretary came with a radio-
      cassette player and after the 
      speech she put on Yesterday by 
      the Beatles. You cant imagine. 
      Everybody turned round to look at 
      her. Apparently, it wasnt planned. 
      His grandchildren were there. Of 
      course they giggled as soon as the 
      music began. Then the urn was put 
      on a huge stretcher that was 
      obviously designed for a coffin, 
      and out we went into the rain. They 
      placed the urn on a small electric 
      cart that crawled along for what 
      seemed like an eternity to the tiny 
      hole they had dug. A lot of people 
      had to stifle their laughter. It 
      must have been terrible for Jeanne. 
      I have... 


                                      29.
PAUSE. 

             ANNE 
      (interrupting him)
      Theres just no point in going on 
      living. I know it can only get 
      worse. Why should I inflict it on 
      us? On you and me. 

              GEORGES
      Youre not inflicting anything on 
      me. 

              ANNE
      You dont have to lie, Georges. 

             GEORGES
      Imagine you were me. Didn't you 
      ever think something like this 
      could happen to one of us? 

              ANNE
      Of course I did. But imagination 
      and reality have little in common. 

              GEORGES
      But things are getting better every 
      day. Well... 

             ANNE 
      (interrupting him)
      Georges, I don't want to carry on. 
      Youre making such efforts to make 
      everything easier for me. But I 
      don't want to go on. For my own 
      sake. Not yours. 

             GEORGES
      I don't believe you. I know you. 
      You think youre a burden on me. 
      But what if things were the other 
      way around? What would you do then? 

             ANNE
      I don't know. I can't be bothered 
      to think about being you. Im 
      tired. You tire me. Everything 
      tires me. I cant talk. I want to 
      go to bed. 

He looks at her. Finally he gets up and pushes her wheelchair 
out of frame. 

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT


                                      30.
She is lying in bed. The bedside lamp is on. 

We hear the RADIO coming from the living room: a program 
about the fauna and flora of the South Seas, or something 
similar. 

INT. HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Georges comes out of the kitchen and opens the front door. On 
the doorstep stands the soloist (male or female) from Scenes 
3 and 4. 

              GEORGES 
      (somewhat perplexed, but pleased) 
      Oh hello! Nice to see you. 

             SOLOIST
      Forgive me for dropping in on you 
      like this, Professor. I tried to 
      reach you by phone a couple of 
      times, but no luck. 

             GEORGES
      Im sorry. I only pick up the phone 
      when Ive stored the caller's 
      number and I can see who's calling. 
      Why didn't you leave a message? 
      Anyway, do come in... 

He closes the door behind his guest. 

             SOLOIST
      I just couldnt manage to come by 
      after the concert. I was so sorry, 
      because I was so pleased you came 
      along. 

              GEORGES
      Come with me. 

While they pass into the living room, they continue to speak:

             SOLOIST
      ... And now, an unexpected 
      opportunity has arisen because 
      Franois Mitry called me - you know 
      him, hes my agent - to say he'd 
      arranged for me to meet the boss of 
      the Thtre des Champs-Elyses 
      tonight to talk about their new 
      concert series. 
             (MORE)


                                      31.
             SOLOIST
	(CONT'D)
      So I flew to Paris this morning, 
      and while I was in my hotel, I 
      thought, I'll just give it a try 
      and drop in. After all, it's 
      virtually just around the corner.

Sorry, these are for your wife. 

He takes the bouquet of flowers from its wrapping paper and 
hands it to Georges. 

             SOLOIST
	(CONTD)
      Isn't she at home? 

              GEORGES
      Yes, she is. Ill go and get her in 
      a minute. Have a seat. 

              SOLOIST
      I hope Im not disturbing you too 
      much. 

             GEORGES
      No, not at all. Im happy that you 
      came. We were so thrilled by your 
      concert. We hoped wed see you 
      again soon. Please do have a seat. 
      Can I can get you something? A cup 
      of tea? 

              SOLOIST
      No, no, thank you very much. 

             GEORGES
      Hold on, Ill just freshen up the 
      flowers; in this heat they wilt so 
      fast... 

              SOLOIST
      I've only just bought them. They 
      should keep quite... 

But Georges has already left the room with the bouquet and 
closed the door behind him. The soloist looks around him. 

After a few moments we hear the VOICES of Anne and Georges in 
the distance, without understanding what theyre saying. It 
lasts a while. 

Finally Georges opens the door and pushes Anne, in her 
wheelchair, into the living room. 


                                      32.
              ANNE
      Martin! What a delight. How lovely 
      to see you! 

The (male or female) soloist has got up and doesn't quite 
know how to handle the situation. 

             SOLOIST
      Mrs. Laurent! Lovely to see you 
      too. 

              ANNE
      Don't get up. Come on, sit yourself 
      down and don't look so shocked. 

The soloist sits down hesitantly, Georges pushes the 
wheelchair between the two armchairs and also sits down. 
Brief embarrassed PAUSE.

             ANNE
	(CONTD)
      Im so proud of you. We were both 
      in raptures after your concert. 
      Georges wanted to buy your new CD 
      the very next morning. 

             SOLOIST
      Oh God! I wanted to bring you the 
      CD, but I left in such a hurry that 
      I forgot it. Im so sorry. Ill get 
      one today and drop it by. 

             ANNE 
      (smiling)
      No, no, don't worry. We want to 
      make a contribution to your 
      success. Even if its only twenty 
      euros. 

              SOLOIST
      Youve already contributed so much. 
      I owe you so much, Madame. 

              ANNE
      You owe it to your hard work and 
      your talent. 

             SOLOIST 
      (shaking his head a little) Do you 
      remember, when you first gave me 
      the Bagatelles to play? I was 
      twelve at the time, and in my 
      youthful arrogance I said: But why 
      the Bagatelles? And you really 
      gave me a piece of your mind. 


They both smile. PAUSE. Then he goes on: 
                                      33.

              SOLOIST
	(CONTD)
      So what happened? 

              ANNE
      My right side is paralyzed, thats 
      all. It can happen when you get 
      older. 

              SOLOIST
      And how...? 

              ANNE
      Let's talk about something else, 
      shall we? 

              SOLOIST 
      (disconcerted)
      Sure ... 

             ANNE
      Dont be offended. But I want to 
      enjoy the lovely interlude you've 
      given us with your visit. 

              SOLOIST 
      (disarmed) 
      Of course. 

Brief PAUSE. 

              GEORGES
      You haven't told us yet what's been 
      going on since the Paris concert. 

The soloist is a bit thrown by the couples behavior. 

             SOLOIST
      Well, actually I've spent most of 
      the time in London studying. Then I 
      went to Copenhagen for two 
      performances, that was Schubert 
      too. My whole life revolves around 
      Schubert at the moment. The 
      concerts with the Impromptus and 
      the Moments Musicaux, and for my 
      bread-and-butter work I'm 
      developing the sonatas. Not the 
      late ones, I think I still need a 
      couple more years for those. 


(The dialogue concerning music will be modified according to the performer chosen.) 

                                      34.

             ANNE
      Could you do me a favor? 

              SOLOIST 
      (surprised) 
      Really? 

              ANNE
      Would you play Fr Elise? 

             SOLOIST 
      (embarrassed) 
      Um, I dont know if  I remember it 
      very well. Beethoven, its been a 
      long time since Ive... But if you 
      want... 

              ANNE
      Give it a try. 

              SOLOIST 
      (hesitantly)
       OK. 

He looks at Georges, then at Anne again, gets up, goes to the 
grand piano and plays. 

INT. HALLWAY - DAY   

Georges is leaning against the chest, and watches Anne, who 
is practicing maneuvering her new electric wheelchair. 
Forward, backward, turning. In the end, she goes round and 
round in circles several times. He laughs, so does she. 

INT. BEDROOM - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Anne is lying in bed. A book rests on her stomach. She 
listens to the PIANO playing coming from the living room. 
After a while the music stops. 

              ANNE
      What's the matter? 

LIVING ROOM 

Georges is seated in front of the open piano. His hands in 
his lap, he looks straight ahead. 

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY


                                      35.
The superintendents wife runs the vacuum cleaner over a 
carpet. 

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Anne is seated on a stool. Georges washes her. 

INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - TWILIGHT

Georges has cooked himself a steak and is eating. On the 
radio, we hear the EVENING NEWS. Suddenly, coming from the 
neighboring room, a LOUD CRASH and the SOUND of crockery 
breaking. Stifled CRY from Anne. Georges gets up, irritated, 
crosses the HALLWAY and enters the BEDROOM. 

Anne lies on the floor, beside the overturned night stand, in 
the midst of the crockery and remains of a meal. 

              GEORGES 
      (shocked, and hence furious)
      Good God, what are you doing? 

He hurries toward her and pulls her up rather roughly into 
the bed. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Have you lost your senses?! I don't 
      believe it! How stupid! 

He points to the broken objects. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Look at that! Did you need to do 
      that? Cant you call me when you 
      need something? 

              ANNE 
      (meekly) Im sorry. 

              GEORGES 
      (still furious) 
      Yes, so am I. 

              ANNE
      (softly) 
      Sorry. 

Georges bends down, and begins to gather up the scattered 
objects. 

              GEORGES
      The lamp is broken too. 

INT. BATHROOM - HALLWAY - ANNEX - DAY


                                      36.
Bathroom.

Georges, in pajama pants, naked torso, brushes his teeth. The 
doorbell rings. 

Georges spits out, wipes his mouth, goes into the hallway and 
over to the front door. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Yes? Whos there? 

No answer. Georges is very irritated. O.S., Anne calls to 
him: 

              ANNE
      Georges? Whats going on? Who is 
      it? 

Georges opens the door. Outside, however, instead of the 
usual landing, we see an empty room lit a giorno but without 
a window, about as large as the rooms in the apartment. It 
looks like an unpainted room in a new apartment. A couple of 
ladders are propped against the opposite wall. At the other 
end of the room, to the side, is a small door. Georges is 
stunned, and doesn't understand what has happened. 
Hesitating, he crosses the room toward the door. 

O.S., in the distance, Annes worried voice: 

              ANNE
	(CONTD)
      Georges? Whats going on? 

Georges opens the small door. Behind it is a narrow, 
windowless corridor, as brightly lit as the room. At the end 
of the corridor, a door. Georges heads toward this door and 
opens it too. Behind it is a tiny windowless room, equally 
bright as the others. Everything is very quiet. Georges 
enters, turns round, then goes back along the corridor, 
crosses the room, comes through the apartment door into the 
hallway of the apartment. But it too is now empty and bright, 
with bare unpainted walls, no doors; only the door to the 
bedroom is open. Behind that too, it appears to be empty and 
bright. Georges goes toward it.

At the same time, we hear GEORGES' VOICE. At first he groans, 
but then begins inarticulately hollering, louder and louder. 
Shortly after, we also hear:

              ANNE'S VOICE:
       Georges, what's going on?

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

             ANNES VOICE 
      Calm down will you! There's nothing 
      there. Its nothing. 

She manages to switch on the bedside lamp. Georges is sitting 
up in his bed, having just awoken, wide-eyed with terror. His 
breathing is labored. 

Anne extends her good hand toward him, caresses his back to 
calm him. He slowly calms down and flops back on his pillow. 

              ANNE
      What was it? 

He doesn't answer. Continues breathing heavily. She caresses 
him. 

             GEORGES 
      (still with labored breathing)
       I didn't understand... I thought 
      Id gone mad... It was something 
      impossible... 

              ANNE
      What was? 


INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Close shot on the screen of a cell phone. We read on it: 

Coming to Paris on 12th. Plan to stop by in afternoon. Hope 
all well. So look forward to seeing you. Love Eva. 

We hear O.S. the voice of 

              GEORGES
      Eva. Theyre coming on the 12th. 

He crouches down in front of Anne who is seated on the bed, 
puts his mobile phone back in his pocket and continues to put 
on her socks and her shoes. 

              ANNE
      Why? 

              GEORGES
      No idea. Apparently shes coming 
      with Geoff. 

              ANNE
      When is it? 


                                      38.
              GEORGES
      I don't know exactly. What day is 
      it today? Ill go and look. 

Short PAUSE. 

              ANNE
      I don't want that. 

              GEORGES
      What? 

              ANNE
      Geoff doesn't need to come. 

PAUSE. 

Georges doesn't agree, but continues to dress Anne. 

             ANNE
	(CONTD)
      I don't need any comments on my 
      predicament. I can only take his 
      British humor in small doses. 

INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Once more the set of physiotherapy exercises. Things are 
going better. Georges smiles encouragingly at Anne, noticing 
her improvement. She reacts like someone duty-bound, but 
without conviction. 

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Close shot: a CD is inserted into a player. As the MUSIC 
begins (the concert heard in Scene 3), Georges takes a card 
out of the envelope that contained the CD and reads it to 
Anne: 

             GEORGES
      Dear Madame Laurent, Dear Monsieur 
      Laurent, it was beautiful and yet 
      sad to see you. My heartfelt wishes 
      that things will get better. 
      With deep gratitude, your former 
      pupil, Martin. 

The MUSIC makes their SILENCE less awkward. Then, after a 
long while, Anne says: 

              ANNE
      Stop the CD. 

He hesitates, looks at her, then stops the music. They remain 
SILENT. 


                                      39.
SCENE 33- INT. KITCHEN - ADJOINING ROOM - DAY

They eat. Suddenly, Anne says: 

              ANNE
	(CONTD)
      Where are the family albums? 

              GEORGES
      The family albums? I don't know, 
      there, in the other room. Why? 

             ANNE
      Can you get them for me? 

              GEORGES
      What, now? 

Anne nods. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Why, Anne? 

              ANNE
      Id like to look at them. 

Georges hesitates, and doesn't understand the suddenness of 
this request. 

              ANNE
	(CONTD)
      Please! 


He finally gets up and goes into the adjoining room. He comes 
back after a few moments with a stack of albums, pushes away 
the remains of Anne's meal and sets down the first album in 
front of her. 

              ANNE
	(CONTD)
      Thanks. 

             GEORGES 
      (a bit irritated)
      Youre welcome. 

With her able hand, Anne opens the album, looks at the 
photos, turns the pages, looks. 

              ANNE
      That's nice. 

              GEORGES 
      (self-consciously, softly)
      What? 


                                      40.
              ANNE
      Life...so long... What a long 
      life... 

Georges looks at her. She continues to thumb through the 
pages. After a while she turns toward him. 

              ANNE
	(CONTD)
      Stop watching me. 

              GEORGES 
      (caught in the act) 
      I wasn't watching you. 

              ANNE
      Of course you were. Im not that 
      dumb yet. 

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT  

They are both lying in bed. Georges reads the day's news to 
Anne from the newspaper. When he looks over to her, she has 
fallen asleep. He then puts the newspaper on the night stand 
and turns out the light. 

INT. BEDROOM - HALLWAY - BATHROOM - DAY  

Bedroom. 

Its morning. Georges is helping Anne to get out of bed into 
her wheelchair. As he does it, he notices that the bed and 
her nightgown are wet.

               GEORGES
      Youre soaked through. 

              ANNE
      What do you mean? 

Brief PAUSE. 

              GEORGES
      Hold on. 

He sits her back on the bed and goes out of the room. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Ill be right back.

During this time, she remains seated, feeling embarrassed, 
and waits. He comes back with a towel and puts it on the seat 
of the wheelchair. 


                                      41.
              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Its no big deal. Come on. 

He lifts her out of the bed into the wheelchair and pushes 
her through the hallway into the bathroom. 

He lifts her out of the wheelchair, sits her on the stool and 
takes off her wet nightgown, pulling it over her head. She 
starts to SOB inconsolably. He caresses her face. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Come on, darling. Its nothing 
      serious. Things like that happen.. 

              ANNE
      (sobbing)
      I cant... take it any more.

He holds her tightly against him, strokes her hair, feeling 
helpless. 

              GEORGES
      My love. My darling. 

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Anne is in bed. Shes on a drip. Eva is seated on a chair 
beside the bed. 

             EVA
      ... thinking about whether it 
      wouldnt be better to invest the 
      money in an apartment block. If 
      inflation gets going again, 
      property is the only sure thing. 
      Right now, savings accounts pay 
      1.75% at best. Four years ago, 
      Geoff bought some stocks with a 
      small sum of money and the whole 
      thing collapsed. So now were 
      obviously worried. Unfortunately, 
      in the meantime, other people have 
      had the same idea, and property 
      prices are going through the roof. 
      Since we came back from 
      Scandinavia, I spend all my spare 
      time looking through newspaper ads. 

To put an end to the PAUSE that follows, she adds: 

              EVA
	(CONTD)
      It takes time, thats all. Well 
      find something in the end. 


Another oppressive PAUSE. 
                                      42.

             ANNE 
      (slowly) Yes yes I have... I 
      have... the grandmother... woman 
      with house... not... the house then 
      ... money 

              EVA
      I don't understand you, I'm afraid. 

             ANNE
      ... yes... now... its all... house 
      sel... sel... sel... was... in two 
      strokes of... so quickly... god 
      its hard... to say... sell... 
      money gone... left... there too... 

PAUSE. Eva has tears in her eyes. 

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Georges and Eva's husband, GEOFF, around fifty. He speaks 
with a British accent. 

             GEORGES
       ... three times a week... Im not 
      experienced enough. Well see if 
      thats enough. 

             GEOFF
      How much is she asking? 

              GEORGES
      Its paid by the hour. Well see. 

             GEOFF
      And her? 

              GEORGES
      Anne? 


Geoff nods. Georges shrugs. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Its hard to say. Sometimes I get 
      the feeling shes totally unaware 
      of the state shes in. And then I 
      feel the opposite. Its... I don't 
      know. 

             GEOFF
      And what about the doctor? What 
      does he say? 


                                      43.
              GEORGES
      He's... 


Eva comes in through the door. Shes in floods of tears. 

             EVA 
      (crying)
      She only talks gibberish. I don't 
      know what... 

Geoff gets up, hesitantly. 

             GEOFF 
      Hey, dear... 

He goes toward her and leads her to the armchair where he was 
sitting. 

             GEOFF
	(CONTD)
      ...come here, sit down, it's OK. 

She shakes him off, irritated, and sits down. 

              EVA
      Nothing is OK. 

At first hes vexed by her brusque response, but then goes to 
sit down on the sofa. Meanwhile, Eva turns to Georges: 

             EVA
	(CONTD)
      Whats going on, actually? You 
      cant just leave her lying on her 
      bed like that! Shes 
      unrecognizable! It's ridiculous! 

             GEORGES
      We cant do anything for the 
      moment. Calm down, darling. Shes 
      getting medical treatment, they 
      give her the necessary medication, 
      and there are no other options 
      right now. 

              EVA
      What does that mean, no other 
      options? Why isnt she in a 
      hospital? 

             GEORGES
      She had a second stroke. Bertier 
      examined her and felt we could 
      spare her all the hospital 
      inpatient procedures. 
             (MORE)


                                      44.
             GEORGES
	(CONT'D)
      Anyway, they wouldnt keep her, 
      they'd send her to a care home. 
      What they do in those places, we 
      can do here. 

Eva looks at him, amazed. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      And she won't be put in a care 
      home. I promised her that. 

             GEOFF
      Don't you think youre taking on 
      too much? 

              GEORGES
      Have you got a better idea? 

Geoff doesn't know what to say. Eva has composed herself 
somewhat and blows her nose. 

             EVA
      I cant believe that these days 
      there's no way of handling this 
      efficiently. 

              GEORGES 
      (curtly) 
      No ones stopping you from finding 
      out. 

Eva gets up, furious, and goes to the window. Georges follows 
her with his eyes. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      (peaceably) 
      Believe me, I love your mother as 
      much as you do. So please, don't 
      treat me as if I was a total idiot 
      incapable of doing the obvious. 

             EVA
      I didn't say that. Im simply 
      questioning whether what I see 
      going on here is the answer to 
      everything! 

             GEOFF 
      (to Georges) 
      Don't you want to get a second 
      opinion? 


                                      45.
             GEORGES
      Now you two had better stop, OK? 
      Another doctor did come. He said 
      Bertier was right. From Monday, a 
      nurse will come three times a week. 
      Now can we talk about something 
      else? 

              EVA
      Like what? 


INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 

Georges washes the tea cups that he used for Eva and Geoff. 
On the radio, the EVENING NEWS. 

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

With expert gestures, a nurse shows Georges how to lie Anne 
down and put an incontinence pad on her. Shes now almost 
incapable of moving, and has to be turned over like an 
object, as tears flow silently down her face. 

INT. LIVING ROOM -DAY

Anne is at the piano and plays the piece from the Scene 3. We 
watch her and listen to her for a while.

Georges is seated in his armchair and looks at the piano. 
Finally he leans over toward the CD player and stops it. The 
MUSIC suddenly stops. Georges remains silently seated. 

INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY   

He prepares a bowl of muesli, fills a sipping cup with water 
and brings both into the bedroom. Sits down on the bed close 
to Anne to feed her her food. 

              GEORGES
      There, my love, I hope you like it. 

              ANNE
      OK... 


He begins to feed her. 

              GEORGES
      I added a little orange juice. I 
      find it tastes quite good. 

She can only swallow slowly, and so something keeps running 
back out of her mouth. He wipes it with a tea towel, 
continues to feed her. Finally, after a few mouthfuls, she 
keeps her mouth shut. 


                                      46.
             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Come on, Anne, you have to eat some 
      more. You've only swallowed three 
      mouthfuls. 

Anne continues to keep her lips sealed. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Please, darling. A bit more. 

Anne doesn't move. He puts the muesli on the night stand and 
holds the sipping cup to her lips. She drinks slowly, one sip 
after the other. He pulls the cup back between each sip, to 
give her more time. Suddenly she says: 

              ANNE
      ...Mom to the concert... 

              GEORGES
      Yes? 

              ANNE
      ...Mom to the concert... no 
      dress... 

              GEORGES
      Mom has no dress for the concert? 

              ANNE
      ...Mom to concert... no ... uuu... 
      no... 

              GEORGES
       Yes? 


Long PAUSE. Georges waits. 

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Georges and the nurse install Anne on a metal armchair in the 
shower. 

As she does so, the nurse keeps talking reassuringly to Anne. 
Finally, she turns on the tap. 

              ANNE
      (in a monotone)
      Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! 
      Help!... 

Without being phased, the nurse continues to speak 
reassuringly. Georges remains standing there, helpless. 

INT. KITCHEN - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY


                                      47.
Kitchen. 

Georges and the nurse are seated at the table with a cup of 
coffee. In front of the nurse, on the table, is a sum of 
money. As they speak, we hear, coming from the room, Anne's 
CALLS FOR HELP. 

             NURSE
      ... we could take turns. Shed come 
      from 8 till 12 and Id do 2 until 
      6, or 3 to 7. That would certainly 
      relieve the pressure on you. 

              GEORGES
      Ill think about it. 

              NURSE
      She just has to know in time so she 
      can arrange it in her schedule. 

              GEORGES
      Yes, of course, Ill let you know 
      in the next few days. 

              NURSE
      Very well. I have to go now... 

She takes the money on the table, pockets it and gets up. 

              NURSE
	(CONTD)
      Thanks for the coffee. 

              GEORGES
      My pleasure. Ill see you out. 

They both leave the kitchen. As the nurse, in the hallway, 
takes her jacket off the hook in the closet and puts it on, 
she comments on Anne's continuing CALLS FOR HELP. 

             NURSE 
      You mustn't take it too seriously. 
      Usually they always say something. 
      She might just as well say Mom, 
      Mom, Mom. Its just mechanical. 

              GEORGES 
      (nodding, softly)
      I know. 

Theyve reached the door. 

              NURSE
      Goodbye, sir. 


                                      48.
              GEORGES
      Goodbye. 


He closes the door behind her. Remains motionless a moment, 
then goes into the bedroom, where Anne's CALLS FOR HELP, 
unaltered, continue. 

Georges sits down beside Anne on the bed, takes her hand, 
holds her. After a while, Anne calms down, her CALLS FOR HELP 
become quieter and finally stop altogether. 

After a long PAUSE: 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      (slowly, softly)
      Id like to hire a second nurse. 
      The two could take turns. That 
      would make everything a bit 
      simpler. What do you think? 

Long PAUSE. Then: 

              ANNE 
      (softly) ...Help...Help... 

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT  

They are both lying in bed. Georges SNORES noisily. Annes 
eyes are open. 

INT. HALLWAY - KITCHEN - DAY

The front door. We hear the key in the lock. Georges enters 
with a shopping bag, and behind him is the superintendent. He 
carries bigger and heavier bags. Georges holds the door open 
for him. 

              GEORGES
      Would you mind putting them in the 
      kitchen. 

The superintendent precedes him into the kitchen with the 
bags. Georges calls toward the bedroom: 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Im ba-aack! 

He then follows the superintendent into the kitchen. 

The superintendent has put the bags on the work surface. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Thanks very much. 


                                      49.
               SUPERINTENDENT
      Can I do anything else for you, 
      sir? 

              GEORGES
      No, thanks, Mr. Mry. You've been a 
      big help.

               SUPERINTENDENT
      Oh, its nothing, sir. 

Georges has already taken out his wallet and gives some money 
to the superintendent. 

               SUPERINTENDENT
	(CONTD)
      Thanks a lot, sir. 

              GEORGES
      Ill let you know if I need you 
      again. 

               SUPERINTENDENT
      With pleasure, sir. 

He gets ready to leave. He stops again in the doorway and 
turns around. 

               SUPERINTENDENT
	(CONTD)
       May I say something, sir? 

             GEORGES
       What is it? 

              SUPERINTENDENT
      My wife and I, we're very impressed 
      by the way you're managing 
      everything. I take my hat off to 
      you. 

As he speaks, Georges' mobile phone has started to ring. 

             GEORGES
      (taking the mobile phone from the 
      pocket of his jacket)
      Thats very kind of you. Thanks. 
      See you soon. 

               SUPERINTENDENT
      Give my regards to your wife. 

              GEORGES
      I certainly will. Thanks. 


                                      50.
As the superintendent leaves the apartment, Georges looks at 
the display on his mobile phone and makes a call. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Hello Eva, how are you?... Things 
      are fine. 

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Georges, standing at the foot of the bed, faces Anne and 
starts singing. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      (insistently)...Sur le pont ... 

              ANNE
      ... Ssssur... 

              GEORGES
      ...Sur le pont... 

              ANNE
      po  pont  sss

              GEORGES
      ...Sur le pont ... Sur le pont ... 

              ANNE
      ... Ssssur le pont ... 

              GEORGES 
      (smiling to encourage her): ... Sur 
      le pont d'Avignon... 

              ANNE
      ... ssur le .. 

             GEORGES
      ... pont... Sur le pont 
      d'Avignon... (he begins to sing): 
      Sur le pont dAvignon on y danse, 
      on y danse, sur le pont dAvignon 
      tout le monde y danse en rond...

He encourages her to sing with him. Starts singing again: 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Sur le pont d' Avignon, on y danse, 
      on y danse 

Anne tries to sing too, she has a hint of a smile on her 
face, but she produces only isolated SOUNDS. 


                                      51.
             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      (singing to encourage Anne, 
      accompanied by the sounds that she 
      produces): Sur le pont dAvignon on 
      y danse, on y danse  Sur le pont 
      dAvignon tout le monde y danse en 
      rond ... 

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

A second nurse is doing Annes hair roughly. The brush sticks 
in her tangled hair. 

             SECOND NURSE 
      (cheery)
      ... there we are...now were all 
      beautiful again...so everybody will 
      admire us...there...you see... 
      wait... 

She takes a mirror that she has placed within reach. Holds it 
in front of Anne's face. 

             SECOND NURSE
	(CONTD)
      Well?... What do we say to that? 
      Arent we a pretty sight? 

Anne, sickened, averts her eyes. Emits a muffled SOUND. The 
nurse ignores it. 

             SECOND NURSE
	(CONTD)
      Youll see, Monsieur will be 
      dazzled by you... 

Furious SOUND from Anne. 

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

The window opening onto the light well is open. A pigeon has 
landed on the window ledge. 

It walks to and fro, then finally dares to jump down inside, 
onto the floor. It starts to explore the surroundings. 

We hear the TOILET FLUSH. Georges comes out of the toilet. 
The door opening frightens the pigeon. Alarmed, flapping its 
wings, it flutters about the room. 

After a moment of surprise, Georges tries to shoo it back 
toward the window. But the bird escapes in the opposite 
direction. George follows it. 

He closes the doors of the other rooms. Coming from the 
bedroom, we faintly hear ANNES VOICE. 


                                      52.
Georges fetches a towel from the bathroom. He chases the 
bird. He hits out at the bird for so long that it escapes 
back out through the window. Georges, visibly exhausted, has 
to sit down on the chest in the hallway. 

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Georges and the second nurse. 

             NURSE
      ... as you wish, sir. I don't know 
      what you were expecting. I gave up 
      another job to come and work here. 
      You should have thought it over 
      before deciding whether you wanted 
      a second nurse or not. 

              GEORGES
      But I've only just found out how 
      incompetent you are. 

             NURSE 
      (furious)
      What's that supposed to mean? 

              GEORGES
      I don't want to discuss it with 
      you. Anyway, you wouldnt 
      understand. 

              NURSE
      No one has ever complained. 

              GEORGES
      Good for you. (To get rid of her) 
      How much do I owe you? 

             NURSE 
      (after a brief calculation)
      Seven hundred and eighty euros. 

Georges takes his wallet from his jacket hanging on the 
armchair and takes out eight one-hundred euro bills. The 
nurse is hopping mad. 

             NURSE
	(CONTD)
      I've never had anything like this 
      happen to me before. Who do you 
      think you are?! Ive been doing 
      this job for ten years. I don't 
      need you to teach me how to do it. 

              GEORGES
      Do you have twenty euros? 


                                      53.
The nurse takes out her purse angrily, looks inside. 

              NURSE
      No. 

              GEORGES
      Then take the eight hundred euros. 
      You can go now. 

The nurse pockets the money. 

              NURSE
      Youre a nasty old man. I feel 
      sorry for you. 

Georges has put back his wallet, turns to her again and looks 
at her. 

             GEORGES
      I hope from the bottom of my heart 
      that one day someone treats you the 
      way you treat your patients, and 
      that you too will have no way of 
      defending yourself. Now get out. 

She looks at him, at first doesn't know what to answer, then: 

              NURSE
      Go fuck yourself, you old fart! 

She leaves, slamming the door behind her. A few seconds 
later, we hear the front door of the apartment fall shut. 
Georges sits down in his armchair, looks straight ahead. Then 
he lights a cigarette, his hands shake, he smokes. 

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

He tries to pour some tea into her mouth with the sipping 
cup. She won't loosen her lips. 

             GEORGES
      ... Please, open your mouth... go 
      on... open it... Anne! Please!... 
      come on... stop that!... 

He sits upright. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      If you don't drink, youll die. 

Indecipherable SOUND from ANNE. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
       Is that what you want? 


                                      54.
PAUSE. She looks at him. He bends over her again, presents 
the cup in front of her sealed lips. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Come on, Anne, please. 

She doesn't react. He opens her lips with his fingers and 
tries carefully, but using some force, to separate her teeth. 
Pours a little tea in. The liquid runs out of her mouth.

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      (angrily)
      Goddammit! 

He puts down the cup, takes a towel and wipes the liquid, 
some of which has run down onto the pillow. He tries to mop 
it up. She watches him the whole time. Finally he puts the 
towel down beside the cup and looks at her. Tries not to show 
his helplessness and his anger. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Anne! ... You cant force me to let 
      you die of thirst. If you persist, 
      Ill call Bertier and hell put you 
      in hospital. They can force-feed 
      you there. Is that what you want? 

BRIEF PAUSE. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      I promised to spare you that. But 
      you must help me. Im out of my 
      depth. 

He takes the cup again and puts it against her lips. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Please, Anne! 

Her lips remain sealed. He presses the cup hard against them. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Drink that, now! 

It hurts her, so she opens her mouth and lets in a little 
liquid. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      There! 

She closes her mouth again and he puts down the cup. 


                                      55.
             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Good. 

Then she spits it all out like a fountain. After a moment of 
bewilderment, he slaps her. 

SILENCE. Hes frightened by his own gesture. Then he puts 
down the cup and sits on the chair beside the bed. They don't 
look at each other. 

LONG PAUSE. 

              ANNE 
      (softly) 
      Help... help... 

              GEORGES 
      (softly) 
      Please, forgive me. 

PAUSE. 

PAUSE. 

              ANNE 
      (softly) Help... Help... Help... 
      Help... 

INT. APARTMENT - DAY

The various paintings hanging in the apartment. Without their 
frames. Like views on various realities. 

SILENCE. Sometimes, the REMOTE sound of TRAFFIC in the 
distance. 

INT. HALLWAY - LIVING ROOM - DINING ROOM - DAY

Living room. 

Georges is drinking tea and reading the newspaper. SILENCE. 
Suddenly, the DOORBELL RINGS. 

Georges, annoyed, puts down his newspaper, gets up, goes into 
the hallway and goes to the front door. 

             GEORGES
      Whos there? 

             EVAS VOICE
      Its me. 


                                      56.
              GEORGES
      Eva? 


             EVAS VOICE 
      (a bit irritated) Yes. 

Georges, panicked, thinks for a few seconds. 

              GEORGES
      Just a minute. 

He goes toward the bedroom door, locks it and puts the key in 
his pocket. He goes into the dining room, also closes the 
door leading to the bedroom. He comes back. He is about to go 
toward the front door, but remains motionless an instant, 
opens the door of the toilet that is located just nearby, 
flushes the toilet, closes the toilet door again and opens 
the front door. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Hello. 

A brief kiss hello. 


              EVA
      Hello. What was going on? 

              GEORGES
      I was in the toilet. Sorry. 

He closes the front door behind Eva, indicates the direction 
of the living room. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Come in. 


Eva points to the bedroom with a questioning look. He shakes 
his head as if to play down the question, and indicates back 
in the direction of the living room, as if to say: You 
understand, huh?. Eva is slightly irritated, but follows him 
into the living room. 

He closes the door. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Why this unannounced visit? Where 
      have you come from? 

              EVA
      Whats going on with Mom? 

              GEORGES
      Nothing. What should be going on? 


                                      57.
              EVA
      Well... (gesture toward the 
      bedroom) 

              GEORGES
      Don't you want to sit down first? 

Eva wants to answer, but finally gives in and sits down. 
Georges does the same. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      So why are you in Paris? 

              EVA
      Whats going on with Mom? Why don't 
      you answer the phone? After our 
      last conversation, I left four 
      messages on your answering machine. 
      Why don't you call back? 

              GEORGES
      Sorry. I didn't listen to it. 
      Forgive me. 

              EVA
      Dont you realize were worried? 

              GEORGES
      Your worries are no use to me. 

Eva glares at him. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      No, don't get me wrong. Im not 
      criticizing you. I just don't have 
      the time to deal with your worries, 
      thats all. 

              EVA
      Dad... 


             GEORGES
      No. Let's stop this conversation 
      right there. Im taking care of 
      your mother. Its a full-time job. 
      And Im not saying that to 
      complain, just to explain why I 
      didn't answer your phone calls and 
      why I don't want to have any 
      pointless discussions on the 
      subject. Your mother is just as 
      could have been expected: bad the 
      whole time. 
             (MORE)


                                      58.
             GEORGES
	(CONT'D)
      She is turning more and more into a 
      helpless child, and it's sad and 
      humiliating, for her and for me. 
      And she doesn't want to be seen in 
      that state either. Even the last 
      time you visited, she didn't want 
      you to come. You two have your own 
      life. Nothing wrong with that. But 
      let us have our life too. Even 
      though it's a lousy one. OK?

              EVA
      Dad, whats the matter? 

             GEORGES
      Nothing's the matter; your visit 
      caught me by surprise. And I'm 
      annoyed that you show up here to 
      check that everything's OK. Who do 
      you think you are? 

PAUSE. Eva is speechless. 

              EVA
      I... 


Then she gets up and makes to go to the door. 

              GEORGES
      Stay here, will you! 

She stops short, looks at him. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      (softly, but insistently)
      Please! 

She hesitates a moment, but winds up leaving the living room. 

WE HEAR HER PASS IN THE HALLWAY TO GO INTO THE BEDROOM AND 
HER VAIN ATTEMPT TO OPEN THE DOOR. 

             EVA
	(O.S.)
      Mom? ... Mom?? 

Georges remains seated, motionless, until she comes back. She 
seems upset by the situation, as one would expect. 

              EVA
	(CONTD)
      Tell me, whats going on? Have you 
      gone crazy? 

              GEORGES
      Please, sit down. 


                                      59.
              EVA
      I don't want to sit down. Whats 
      going on here? 

             GEORGES 
      (quietly)
      Nothings going on. I want to spare 
      us all a pointless drama. I presume 
      your mother is asleep. She mostly 
      sleeps the whole day. And then she 
      wakes up at night. If you really 
      want to, well go and see her in a 
      little while. Now, sit down. OK? 

They look at each other. 

Reluctantly, Eva heads toward her armchair and sits down. 
PAUSE. Then Georges goes on in a quiet voice: 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      We do our speech exercises every 
      day, or we sing together. Most of 
      the time, I wake up around 5. At 
      that time, she's still awake. Then 
      we change her incontinence pad. I 
      rub cream on her to avoid sores. 
      Then, around 7, I try to persuade 
      her to eat and drink. Sometimes it 
      works, sometimes not. Sometimes she 
      tells me things from her childhood, 
      then for hours she calls for help, 
      and then an instant later she's 
      giggling away to herself, or 
      crying. Nothing of any of that is 
      worth showing to anyone. 

SILENCE. Eva looks down. Finally, she says: 

             EVA
      (softly) 
      You cant stop me from seeing her. 

              GEORGES 
      (also softly) 
      No. 

They remain seated for a moment, finally Eva gets up. Georges 
follows her into the hallway. 

He unlocks the door and they enter the bedroom. 

The bright light from outside filters through the blinds. 


Eva goes over to the bed, looks at Anne. Finally, she caresses her face, shyly and clumsily. Anne opens her eyes. 
Looks at her. No movement. 

                                      60.

              EVA
      Its me, Mom. 

Anne emits a FURIOUS SOUND. 

              EVA
	(CONTD)
      (helpless) 
      Can I do something for you? Mom... 

              ANNE
      Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... Mom... 

SILENCE. 

Georges has remained by the door. After a while, they both 
leave the bedroom, cross the hallway to come back in the 
living room. 

Georges closes the door. For an instant he puts a consoling 
hand on Eva's shoulder. Then he sits down. 

Eva, trying to compose herself, goes toward the window and 
looks outside. Suddenly she starts sobbing. 

After a while, Georges gets up and goes out of the room. Eva, 
vexed, blows her nose. 

Shortly after, Georges comes back. He has another teacup in 
his hand, puts it down beside his on the table and sits down.

               GEORGES
      The tea isnt very hot any more. 

Eva turns toward him. 

              GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      But it does make you feel better. 

After a short PAUSE, Eva comes toward the table. Sits down. 
He fills her cup. 

              EVA
      Thanks. 


She takes the cup, drinks. Replaces it. Still cant bring 
herself to look at him. 


                                      61.
             GEORGES
      It was silly of me to lock the 
      door. Im sorry. You took me by 
      surprise, thats all. Im sorry. 

She nods her head, indicating she understands. Finally she 
looks at him: 

              EVA
      Whats going to happen now? 

             GEORGES 
      (with a little ironic laugh)
      Whats going to happen now? The 
      nurse comes twice a week, and every 
      two weeks Dr. Bertier and the 
      hairdresser come. Thats what you 
      want to know, right? 
      Things will go on as they have done 
      up until now. They'll go from bad 
      to worse. Things will go on, and 
      then one day it will all be over. 

Brief PAUSE. 

              EVA
      You cant go on like this, Dad. 

              GEORGES
      Can't I? What do you suggest? 

              EVA
      Can't we have a serious talk, you 
      and me? 

             GEORGES
      What do you call a serious talk? 
      What do you want to suggest? Do you 
      want to have Mom live with you? Do 
      you want to pack her off to a care 
      home? Do you? What do you want? Go 
      on, talk to me "seriously"! 

Eva looks at him. 

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

Georges is seated on the bed beside Anne, who is still 
bedridden. 


                                      62.
             ANNE 
      (in a rush)... short... short 
      dress... only I... only I... all 
      long... it was... (with a small 
      gesture to imitate a bell): ding... 
      dong... 

              GEORGES 
      (smiling) 
      Yes, it swung to and fro. 

             ANNE 
      (still rushed) ... yes... to ... 
      fro ... you... very serious... like 
      that... (she imitates a serious 
      countenance, continues in a low 
      voice): like that... serious... 

              GEORGES 
      (unable to keep from laughing a 
      little) Yes. I think I was pretty 
      uptight. 

              ANNE 
      (smiling) yes... up... tight...

PAUSE. Anne puts her hand on Georges. 

              ANNE
	(CONTD)
      ... it was n...nice... 

SILENCE. 

INT. BATHROOM - HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DAY  

BATHROOM 

Georges is shaving. Suddenly we hear, coming from the 
bedroom, 

             ANNES VOICE 
      (loud) Help... Help... Help... 
      Help... Help... 

Georges wipes his face and, to the sound of Anne's cries, 
crosses the hallway and enters the bedroom. 

Anne continues to cry out in a monotone to herself. 

Georges goes over to her bed. 

             GEORGES 
      (trying to calm her like a sick 
      child) What is it?.. 
             (MORE)


                                      63.
             GEORGES 
	(CONT'D)
      Are you in pain?... Whats the 
      matter?... Is your pad full? 

He raises her blanket for an instant and sniffs, then 
replaces it. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      No... So whats hurting you? 

He sits down beside her on the bed. Takes her hand. 

             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      Its all right... it's all right   
      Im here... everythings fine... 
      well... Hold on, Ill tell you a 
      story... but you must be quiet, I 
      cant talk too loud, it wears me 
      out... Here we go: when I was 
      little... well, I wasnt as little 
      as all that... it was toward the 
      end of primary school, so I was 
      about ten, Dad and Mom sent me to a 
      holiday camp. They thought it would 
      do me good to spend the summer with 
      kids my own age... We were lodged 
      in an old castle in the midst of a 
      magnificent wooded landscape... I 
      think it was in the Auvergne... I 
      dont know... in any case it was 
      the opposite of what I'd 
      expected... We had to get up at 6 
      and go for a morning swim. Not far 
      from the castle, there was a pond 
      fed by an icy mountain stream. We 
      entered it running, in a double 
      file. You know, I was never very 
      sporty. They had a program to keep 
      us on the go all day, probably to 
      nip any potential pubescent 
      impulses in the bud ... But the 
      worst thing was the food. The third 
      day after our arrival, there was 
      rice pudding for lunch. I hate rice 
      pudding. We sat at long tables in a 
      huge hall. I didn't want to eat the 
      stuff and the housemaster said to 
      me: You won't get up until youve 
      cleared your plate. So after the 
      meal everybody left the room, and I 
      remained seated, in tears. I had 
      made a secret pact with Mom. I was 
      to send her a postcard every week. 
             (MORE)


                                      64.
             GEORGES
	(CONTD)
      If I was pleased with the place I 
      was to draw some flowers on it, or 
      if not, some stars. She kept the 
      card; it was covered all over in 
      stars. After three hours, I was 
      allowed to leave the table. I went 
      up to my room, got into bed and had 
      a fever of 42 degrees. It was 
      diphtheria. They took me to the 
      nearest hospital where I was put in 
      an isolation ward, which meant that 
      Mom, when she came to visit me, 
      could only wave at me through a 
      window. At some point I lost that 
      postcard. Its a pity. 

Anne has become ever calmer during Georges' story. He still 
holds her hand. 

LONG SILENCE. 

Then Georges reaches across Anne's body to get hold of his 
pillow and presses it over her face. STIFLED SOUNDS from 
Anne. Everything that can still move in her body starts to 
move. Georges presses down heavily on the pillow, lies on it 
with his whole weight, for a long time, until all Anne's 
movements stop. Then he sits up, exhausted, and without 
removing the pillow from her face, remains seated beside her. 

SILENCE. 

INT. HALLWAY - KITCHEN - DAY  

Hallway. 

The front door of the apartment is unlocked. Georges, in city 
clothes, enters with two big shopping bags full of cut 
flowers. He puts down the bags, takes off his coat, hangs it 
in the closet. 

The TELEPHONE RINGS. Georges takes the bags and carries them 
in the kitchen, puts them in the sink, fills it with water. 
He starts to cut the stems and put the flowers in the water. 
We watch him doing so for a while. Meanwhile, the TELEPHONE 
HAS STOPPED RINGING. 

INT. HALLWAY - DAY   

Georges has opened one of the sections of the large wall 
closet. He is looking for a specific dress. He takes some 
out, puts them back inside. One of the dresses slips off its 
hanger and falls to the floor. He picks it up, hangs it up 
again. He ends up finding the one he was looking for. He 
takes it out on its hanger. Closes the closet again. 


                                      65.
Looks at the dress. Then he lowers his arm a little and is 
about to leave the bedroom. He catches his feet in the dress. 

He just saves himself from tripping up by grabbing on to the 
wheelchair that is parked there. Exhausted, he flops down 
into it. 

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT   

With wide adhesive tape, Georges seals up the door frame of 
the bedroom. 

INT. KITCHEN - ADJOINING BEDROOM - HALLWAY - DAY 

Georges is seated at the kitchen table where he had breakfast 
with Anne in Scene 8, and writes a letter. PAUSES for 
reflection. GENTLE COOING OF PIGEONS, scarcely audible. 
Suddenly, Georges starts. 

At the far end of the long kitchen, beside the door between 
the kitchen units, a pigeon is walking. Georges stares at it. 
For a long time. 

Then he gets up slowly and, via the door located beside the 
kitchen table, he goes into the adjoining room.

On the sofa there, he has set up his new bed. He takes the 
wool blanket from the bed and comes back into the kitchen, 
carefully approaches the pigeon that then runs off in alarm. 
Georges carefully opens up the blanket and finally throws it 
over the pigeon. But it manages to escape into the hallway. 

Georges follows it. This action is repeated several times. 
The pigeon is more and more panicky, starts to fly up, 
flutters about in all directions. Georges closes the light-
well window to cut off its escape route. This lasts an 
exhausting amount of time, but he ends up capturing it. He 
cuddles it against him, rolled up in the blanket, leans 
against a wall, then holds it as if it were a baby. 

INT. ADJOINING ROOM - KITCHEN - NIGHT

From the adjoining room, we see Georges seated at the kitchen 
table, writing. Finally we see what he is writing: 

... you won't believe it. A pigeon came in, for the second 
time already, through the light well. This time I caught it. 
In fact it wasnt difficult at all. But I set it free again. 
Im going to ... 

INT. ADJOINING ROOM - KITCHEN - HALLWAY - DAY 


                                      66.
Georges is lying on his bed in the adjoining room, staring at 
the ceiling. O.S., we faintly hear the SOUND of running 
water, and from time to time the CLATTERING OF DISHES. 

After a while, Georges gets up and goes into the kitchen. 

He remains in the doorway and watches Anne who, doing the 
dishes, at first doesnt pay attention to him, then notices 
his presence and shoots him a quick glance, saying casually: 

              ANNE
      Im almost done. 

Georges continues to look at her unwaveringly. 

             ANNES VOICE
      You can put your shoes on if you 
      want.

Georges looks at her an instant longer, passes beside her, 
goes into the hallway, sits down on a stool beside the closet 
and puts on his shoes. O.S. we hear Anne finishing her work. 
She comes out, hangs up her apron in the closet, disappears 
for a few moments into the bathroom. Meanwhile, Georges has 
got up, and looks in the bathroom where, clearly, Anne is 
tidying her hair and sprucing herself up. When she comes out 
again, he takes her coat from the closet and helps her put it 
on. 

              ANNE
      Thanks. 

They head for the front door. 

              ANNE
	(CONTD)
      Aren't you taking a coat? 

Georges thinks a few seconds, then takes his trench-coat from 
the hook and they leave the apartment. 

INT. HALLWAY - BEDROOM - DINING ROOM - LIVING ROOM 
- DAY  

Four long shots: all the windows are open. The sun is 
shining. It is fairly bright. 

Hallway. 

SILENCE. Then the SOUND OF A LOCK BEING OPENED. Eva comes 
into the apartment. Remains a long time beside the door. 
Looks around her, ill at ease. Finally she hesitantly goes 
into the bedroom. 


                                      67.
Anne's twin bed isnt there any more. On Georges bed lies 
only the bare mattress. Eva remains there a moment, then goes 
through the partition door into the dining room. 

There, everything is as usual. Eva continues into the living 
room. 

There too, everything is as usual. Eva stops by the piano 
stool. Looks out of the window, feeling at a loss. Then she 
heads toward the sofa and armchairs in the corner. On the 
table lie the remains of a snack. Eva looks at the table, 
turns again toward the open windows, through which we hear 
STREET NOISE. Then she sits down, exhausted, in one of the 
armchairs. Her diminutive frame seems lost in the big room.
