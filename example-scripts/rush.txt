EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY

Dark clouds passing overhead. 

The bad weather that has hovered over the Eifel mountains, (in 
Germany), the past three days is on it’s way out.. 

AN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY

A pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares. 
Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations..

EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY

The first rays of sunshine break through. The voices of 
international TV commentators in different languages.

           COMMENTATORS
    ...in places the track is still 
    dangerously wet, but following a 
    drivers meeting the decision has been 
    taken. The race is going ahead...

INT. FERRARI - DAY

The eye belongs to a 27 year old Formula 1 RACING DRIVER 
wearing a fireproof balaclava...

Highly intelligent, he also happens to be World Champion. His 
name is painted on the side of his Ferrari. NIKI LAUDA.

           NIKI
    My grandfather always said history is 
    cruel and reductive and no matter how 
    long we live, or how much we achieve - 
    we are remembered for very little. So 
    make sure it's the right things.

NIKI stares up at the clouds. His eyelids flicker. Thinking. 
Agonizing. Wrestling with an all important decision...

Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? Should he be 
using slicks or wets?

EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY

We widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major 
Grand Prix. All around us...

Engines scream into life as DRIVERS start their cars. An 
OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, “One 
Minute”...

Deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently. 

           NIKI
    This is bullshit. We have no control 
    over our legacy. We cannot choose what 
    we are remembered for...

A Ferrari MECHANIC rushes towards NIKI, and shouts in Italian 
above the noise, (we see sub-titles)...

           MECHANIC
    Mass usa slicks. Le vuoi cambiare 
    anche tu?
       (Mass is going on slicks. You 
       want to change?)

NIKI looks in his wing-mirror back to see a red McLaren, white 
helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. A team of 
MECHANICS hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres.

           NIKI
    Otherwise I wouldn’t be remembered for 
    my rivalry with this asshole. And the 
    1976 season. 

NIKI then looks over at the car in pole position beside him. 
Another McLaren, but with number 11, and a Union Jack...

           NIKI
    What about Hunt? Has he changed?

           MECHANIC
    No, he’s going on wets.

The car in pole position: JAMES HUNT, surrounded by TV crews, 
mechanics, girlfriends, hangers-on.. 

The Maclaren team is less than half the size of Ferrari’s, but 
HUNT makes up for this with magnetism. The rock star of F1. 

NIKI’s face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival’s 
glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava, 
flirting with several hot-looking GIRLS..

           NIKI
    I don't know why it became such a big 
    thing. We were just drivers. Busting 
    each other's balls. To me this is 
    perfectly normal. But other people saw 
    it differently. 

           NIKI 
    That whatever it was between us went 
    deeper. And changed us both somehow. 
    Forever.

NIKI stares, then...

           NIKI
    Be, allora usiamo anche noi quells da 
    bagnato.
       (Then we go on wets, too.)

The ten-second board is held up. 

NIKI pulls down his visor...as he and HUNT’s eyes meet for a 
split-second, eyes staring...

NIKI selects second gear for the wet track and revs the 
engine. The dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000 
RPM.

           NIKI
    Maybe that explains the state of mind 
    I was in. And why it happened. The 
    other thing I'm remembered for. 
       (a beat)
    On August 1st, that same year…

CAPTION: “AUGUST 1st, 1976”. 

The STARTER waves the flag. NIKI’s foot hits the floor - his 
engine screams that deafening, stomach rearranging high-pitch 
scream, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd. 

NIKI’s car is catapaulted forward violently, the wheel-spin 
leaving livid black scars on the asphalt..

NIKI gets away first. A good start! But within seconds there’s 
a McLaren car right behind him, breathing down his neck. 

His arch-rival. HUNT. 

But as the McLaren roars past, NIKI sees a white helmet. 
Number 12. It’s not Hunt. It’s MASS. On his bald, slick tyres. 

NIKI curses under his breath. He screwed up. Made the wrong 
decision. Should have gone on slicks. He urgently needs to 
change tyres...

NIKI swerves angrily into the pits. Ferrari’s pit is right at 
one end...

INT. PITS - DAY

Commentary from all the world’s TV stations explaining the 
crazy, panicked situation as all the DRIVERS come into the 
pits to change to dry tyres.

It’s chaos. A traffic jam of Formula 1 cars...

The Ferrari team frantically work. Changing NIKI’s tyres. Four 
men with air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks. The same 
Italian MECHANIC appears, ‘plugs in’ his headset to the car..

           MECHANIC
    Hair visto? Ti aveto detto di usare le 
    slicks! 
       (See? I told you to go on 
       slicks!!)

           NIKI
    Bullshit. Where’s Hunt?

           MECHANIC
    There!  

NIKI looks up to see the name JAMES HUNT written on the black 
helmet roar out of the pits ahead, with new tyres on...

           NIKI
    C’mon...!! 

NIKI screams at the MECHANICS, who are struggling. The airguns 
make a high-pitched noise...something’s not right.

           NIKI
    What’s GOING ON???

“Thump”, new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac, engines scream, and 
NIKI exit the pits in pursuit of HUNT. But the delay has cost 
him dear...

EXT. NUBURGRING - DAY

Archive TV commentary from the world’s race COMMENTATORS 
stations informs us of the positions. 

MASS leading, HUNT in 3rd, LAUDA in 20th...

INT. NIKI’S CAR - DAY

NIKI gives it everything he’s got. Tearing through the gears, 
trying to catch JAMES HUNT, breaking as late as he can, engine 
screaming. 

He flies over the take-off hump between Pflanzgarten and 
Swallowtail - passes one car after another. Into 13th place 
now. Pulling off outrageous manoeuvres. 

NIKI’s P.O.V: the world flies past in a blur. The steering 
wheel shakes. The car is right on the edge. Cannot be driven 
any harder.

NIKI approaches the Streckenteil Adenauer-Brucke section of 
the course...turns left at the Bergwerk corner. Crazy speed. 
And tight. Too tight. A mistake...  

“Thump”, his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the 
inside. NIKI tries to counter-steer, but is travelling at 155 
mph. The car jerks horribly to the right..

“Crunch”, hits the embankment, then “Bang”, hits the barrier, and is thrown across the track.. 

Fire breaks out in the engine. NIKI’s eyes widen in horror, 
with another car bearing down upon him...

           NIKI
    No...!

The oncoming car crashes head-on into our car, “Crash”, a 
sickening, terrifying impact. 

The car explodes. Seventy litres of burning high-octane 
gasoline, with NIKI strapped inside, unable to undo his 
seatbelt. Locked in a blast furnace. 

NIKI screams as the flames engulf him. 800 degrees 
temperature. Trapped inside his car. 

Burning smoke fills his helmet, scarring his lungs...

Pandemonium: commentary in different languages as panicked TV 
commentators helplessly describe what’s happening..

NIKI’s POV: he can just make out the barely recognizable 
figures of the other DRIVERS rushing towards NIKI..

Their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully 
to undo NIKI’s seatbelt..

Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Dry powder extinguishers. 
Covering NIKI’s helmet. Blurring his vision, as he cries out 
in agony, inhaling the powder..

Screaming voices. Panicked reactions. On the side of the car, 
the painted name ‘Niki Lauda’ blisters and melts.

Then sound fades. As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness.

FADE TO BLACK:

Over this: the sound of a ringing phone...


INT. HOSPITAL A&E UNIT - (ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY) - DAY

We’re in a busy hospital A&E unit. Noise. Crowds. A regular 
Saturday late afternoon. The phone continues to ring..

Finally, an attractive station NURSE in her 20’s, run-off-her-
feet, breathlessly picks up the phone. 

           NURSE
    Emergency...

She covers her ears, straining to hear, listening to what is 
being said. Then her expression changes...

           NURSE
    Okay...standing by!

The NURSE hangs up...then calls out to her NURSE and DOCTOR 
colleagues...

           NURSE
    That was the race-track..! There’s 
    been an accident..! A driver’s been 
    injured and is on his way in..!

Instantly the atmosphere changes. A hive of activity as 
DOCTORS and NURSES prepare themselves for a major trauma...

All PATIENTS with minor injuries are cleared out of the way. 

The NURSE rings upstairs to the operating theatres and 
consultant surgeons, telling them to stand by...

CAPTION: “EIGHTY-EIGHT RACES EARLIER”

Swing doors open, and a pair of shoeless, BARE FEET walks 
through and into the accident and emergency unit. 

Camera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing 
overalls...to reveal a tall, good-looking driver, JAMES HUNT, 
(mid 20’s), tanned, athletic, surfer long blonde hair...

A man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to 
describe an Englishman. SEXY. 

Blood trickles from his nose, there is bruising to his lip and 
the formation (already) of a nasty black eye, but make no 
mistake. He rocks. Drop-dead gorgeous.. 

           JAMES
    I think the racetrack telephoned ahead 
    that I was coming? Hunt? James Hunt..?

JAMES notices all the NURSES staring..

           JAMES
    What’s the matter? No one seen a spot 
    of blood before?

           NURSE
    Are you all right?

           JAMES
    Absolutely fine.

INT. A&E UNIT - DAY

The attractive NURSE is examining JAMES, opening his overalls, 
checking for wounds, cuts and bruises...

           NURSE
    We all thought you’d been in an 
    accident. 

           JAMES
    I have. If you call a friendly 
    disagreement with another driver an 
    accident.

           NURSE
    What did you disagree about?

           JAMES
    None of your business. Ouch.

           NURSE
    Sorry. 

           JAMES
    His wife.

           NURSE
    That’s going to need a couple of 
    stitches. It’s a nasty cut.

           JAMES
    It was a nasty blow. Done with a 
    bloody spanner.

           NURSE
    Why? What did you do?

           JAMES
    Nothing! Only what she begged me to 
    do. 

The NURSE notices bruising on JAMES’s chest... 

           NURSE
    Which was..?

She examines him, testing his ribs for fractures, his chest.. 

JAMES looks up. Their eyes meet..

           JAMES
    Be happy to show you if you like.

INT. JAMES’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

‘Crash’, the door flies open as JAMES and the NURSE stumble 
through, mid-embrace, tearing at one another’s clothes...

The apartment is basic. Cramped. Messy. Like that of a poor 
student. Ashtrays filled with half-smoked joints. Empty beer 
cans. A toaster. A kettle. A stereo. A cage containing two 
budgerigars.

A mattress on the floor. 

Newspapers with headlines about the Dockers Strike, England’s 
crumbling economy, Rolls Royce being bailed out by the 
government - subtle reminders of Britain in transition, 
leaving behind its strong, imperial past.

JAMES and the NURSE stand against the wall, still half-
dressed, but already passionately making love...

           JAMES
    I have a theory why women like racing 
    drivers. It’s not because they respect 
    what we do...driving round and round 
    in circles. Mostly they think that’s 
    pathetic. And they’re probably right..
       (a beat)
    It’s our closeness to death.

JAMES and the NURSE continue noisily, tirelessly making love 
in the shower...

           JAMES
    The closer you are to death, the more 
    alive you FEEL...the more alive you 
    ARE. And they can see that in you. 
    FEEL that in you. The way you live. 
    Willing to risk everything. 


           JAMES
    With no thought for tomorrow...as if 
    each day is your last. It’s a 
    wonderful way to live...and the ONLY 
    way to drive. The only way to get that 
    tenth of a second on everyone else...

The lovemaking becomes more intense...

           JAMES
    To dare to be one step bolder...one 
    step faster...

JAMES is covered in perspiration, out on the edge...

           JAMES
    Sure one step closer to death...

JAMES and the NURSE, both screaming as they approach orgasm...

           JAMES
    But one step closer to victory, too...

JAMES and the NURSE both climax together...and collapse on the 
bed. Exhausted. 

EXT. CRYSTAL PALACE RACE TRACK - DAY


A grotty old race track in South London.

JAMES and the NURSE arrive at Crystal Palace race track in his 
battered old mini. They get out. She looks up, seeing the 
mechanics, the racing teams, the cars..

           NURSE
    I’ve never been to a Grand Prix 
    before.

           JAMES
    You still haven’t. This is Formula 3.

           NURSE
    What’s that?

           JAMES
    A lower division. Where people like me 
    mess about in the hope of finding 
    sponsors or being talent-spotted to 
    race in Formula 1.

JAMES leads the NURSE into...

THE PADDOCK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY

The pits where JAMES introduces her to his team...

           JAMES
    Everyone, this is Nursie. 

           NURSIE
       (correcting)
    Gemma...

           JAMES
    Nursie, this is Doc our designer...

           DOC
    How do you do?

           JAMES
    Bubbles, our chief mechanic.

           BUBBLES
    How do you do?

           JAMES
    Le Patron - Alexander, Lord Hesketh. 

           HESKETH
    How do you do?

           NURSE
    Fine, thanks. Blimey...is everyone in 
    Formula 3 this posh? 

           HESKETH
    Glass of champagne, Nursie?

           NURSE
    It’s Gemma. No, thanks.

           HESKETH
    You sure? It’s Krug. Clos de Mesnil.

           NURSE
    It’s also ten in the morning.

           HESKETH
    Oh, dear. Superstar? You haven’t 
    brought us a bore, have you?

JAMES strips off, changing into his racing overalls. 

           JAMES
    Trust me. Nursie’s anything BUT a 
    bore..

The NURSE, meanwhile, drifts over to look at the car where 
BUBBLES is making last minute checks...

           NURSE
    That’s the car?

           BUBBLES
    That’s her. The Dastle Mk 9...with the   
    Lotus twin-cam sixteen hundred engine. 
    She’s no beauty. But goes like the 
    clappers. 

An odd-looking car. A bit like a giant Go-kart, blue with 
yellow strips along the side and James’s name in small 
letters. It looks small, dangerously fragile.

           JAMES
    Uuuurrrrrkkkkkkggghghhhh.

The NURSE is shocked to hear a dreadful watery vomiting sound. 
She sees JAMES bent over behind the truck...

           HESKETH
    Nothing to be worried about! Does it 
    before every race! Good sign, 
    actually. Means he’s stoked!

EXT. PADDOCK - SAME TIME

JAMES continues vomiting...

           JAMES
    There’s a lie that all drivers tell 
    themselves. ”Death is something that 
    happens to other people.” That’s how 
    you find the courage to get in the car 
    in the first place... 

JAMES emerges, wiping his mouth...

           HESKETH
    All right, Superstar?

           JAMES
    Never better, Patron.

           JAMES
    Because bad things only happen to 
    others, right?

           HESKETH
    Have a gargle with this.

JAMES takes a quick swig of the champagne...gargles, then 
swallows, puts on his balaclava...

           JAMES
    Problem is deep down you know that’s a 
    lie. That it could happen to you at 
    any moment.

           HESKETH
    Quick toke of this...

HESKETH passes over a joint, which JAMES inhales, taking a 
huge lungful from....

           JAMES
    So how do you make that terror go 
    away? Well, booze is good for that. 
    And wacky baccy. But better than 
    everything else is...sex.

JAMES goes to the NURSE...and kisses her full on the lips, 
then puts on his helmet, and athletically vaults into the car. 

JAMES hits the ignition, and a deafening high-pitched SCREAM 
as the engine starts...

           HESKETH
    Ahhhh! What music! They could never 
    have predicted it, those pioneers that 
    invented the automobile that it would 
    possess us like this, in our 
    imaginations, our dreams. Nursie, men 
    love women...but even more than that, 
    men love CARS...

EXT. PADDOCK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY

JAMES notices another driver (NIKI LAUDA), his car already 
unloaded, (number 35) and mechanics working on it..

           JAMES
    Who’s that?  

           DOC
    He’s new. Some German.

           BUBBLES
       (corrects)
    Austrian. 

           JAMES
    Is there a difference?

JAMES looks over. On the side of the car, painted markings, in 
the form of a signature, “Niki Lauda”.

           JAMES
    All bloody Goosesteppers.

EXT. RACE TRACK - CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY

JAMES is neck and neck with NIKI. They go into a corner.

NIKI gets there first. Up ahead though, approaching the second 
bend...JAMES sees the tiniest, slimmest crack to overtake. No 
right-minded driver would risk it. Only a suicidal maniac.

Which just happens to describe JAMES perfectly..

JAMES goes for it. Daringly. Brilliantly. And forces NIKI to 
slam on his brakes to prevent a certain crash...

EXT. PITS - SAME TIME

HESKETH, BUBBLES, DOC and the NURSE watch from the 
sidelines...

           BUBBLES
    That move was suicide! 

           HESKETH
    It was also quite brilliant!! God he’s 
    got balls!!

EXT. RACE TRACK - DAY

JAMES carries on driving. Flat out. 

But on the flat, NIKI suddenly comes out of nowhere. As if his 
car has 50 bhp more. 

And overtakes JAMES. NIKI begins to pull away. And has the 
Englishman beaten..

JAMES sees red mist...and in an act of do-or-die vengeful 
madness, JAMES goes into a corner far too fast...

...yanks his steering wheel. And outrageously shunts NIKI’s 
car. An unforgivable act of unsportsmanlike vindictiveness. 

NIKI and JAMES’s cars both veer off...go into wild, lethal 
spins..but luckily for JAMES he ends up facing the right 
way... 

...and despite being badly shaken, dizzy, JAMES is able to 
change gears, and continue driving...

NIKI’s car, by contrast, has stalled...and now ends up facing 
THE WRONG WAY on the track...

NIKI’s eyes look up to see all the cars coming over a brow, 
like a herd of Wildebeest, heading towards him...

           NIKI
    Umgotteswillen...

NIKI rips open his seat-belt, is about to get out of his car, 
when one car shoots straight over the nose of his car.

NIKI ducks, then bravely leaps for cover, as....

“SMASH”, one of the oncoming cars shunts into his car, (it 
would have killed him instantly).

“WHAM”, another car narrowly misses him...

“CRASH”, another car forces NIKI into an evasive dive...

Cars scream past him on all sides as the race continues...

NIKI, battered, shaken, has had an unbelievably close escape. 
He rips off his helmet, furious...

And now we see NIKI LAUDA’s face for the first time. Sharp-
featured. Intelligent eyes. Dark hair. Protruding teeth. 

Something unmistakably rat-like about him.

EXT. CRYSTAL PALACE RACE TRACK - LATE AFTERNOON

JAMES is on the podium, having won. He’s with the NURSE, and 
HESKETH and BUBBLES and his team, spraying them with 
champagne..

NIKI walks past the podium, holding his blue helmet, and 
shouts out, still incandescent...

           NIKI
    Hey...asshole! That was my line! I had 
    that corner...

           JAMES
    You mean the one you spun out of? And 
    finished facing the other way? I think 
    that corner had you. 

Laughter.

           NIKI
    That move was total suicide. What if I 
    hadn’t braked? We’d have crashed..!!

           JAMES
    But we didn’t, did we? Thanks to your 
    impeccable ‘survival’ instincts...

JAMES makes chicken noises...

           NIKI
    Fuck you! What’s your name?

           HESKETH
    James Simon Wallis Hunt. Remember it, 
    my little Jerry friend. Because one 
    day he will be World Champion.

           JAMES
    Jawohl. Remember ze name. Very simple. 
    “Hunt”. It rhymes with....

“BEEEEP”, a car horn hoots nearby, blocking out JAMES’s c-word insult...

           JAMES
    ...a word that happens to describe you 
    perfectly.

Laughter. NIKI gives JAMES the finger, “Screw you, asshole”. 
The NURSE watches NIKI go..

           NURSE
    Who was that?

           JAMES
    No one. Chippy little Kraut. Bad 
    loser. Forget him.

NIKI continues to walk off, middle finger raised..

EXT. VIENNA SKYLINE - DAY

To establish: the Austrian capital. OVER THIS: the sound of 
NIKI’s voice...

           NIKI
    In my home town, Vienna, my family is 
    famous for one thing. Business. My 
    grandfather was a businessman, my 
    father, too...

INT. NIKI’S APARTMENT - DAY

NIKI is in front of a mirror, and dresses smartly in a jacket, 
and open necked shirt, evidently a little nervous...

           NIKI
    So when they heard I wanted to race 
    cars for a living, they had a few 
    things to say...

INT. LAUDA GRANDFATHER HOUSE - NIGHT

A large, forbidding dining room. NIKI’s FATHER and terrifying 
GRANDFATHER, are eating supper. GRANDFATHER shakes his head, 
clearly disapproves and barks in German...(we see subtitles)

           GRANDFATHER
    Never! Racing is for playboys and 
    dilettantes. Frivolous amateurs with 
    nothing in their heads. The name 
    ‘Lauda’ appears on the front pages, 
    with politicians and economists, not 
    on the back pages with...
       (gestures in contempt)
    ...footballers and skiers. If you want 
    my money, you do as I say and follow 
    me into my business..

NIKI stares at his GRANDFATHER..

           NIKI
    It’s in moments like this that you 
    discover who you really are.. 

...and in a move that he knows will rupture the family for 
ever, NIKI gets to his feet..

           NIKI
    Fine. Keep your money. Don’t invest in 
    me. But when I’m World Champion, and I 
    have the trophy, and my name is not 
    just on the back pages, but on the 
    front too, you will regret it. 

 NIKI walks out, the old man’s insults ringing in his ears...

           GRANDFATHER
    You dare sit at my table and lecture 
    me on what I will or won’t regret? Get 
    out! Impertinent wretch! Consider 
    yourself disowned!

INT. RAIFEISENKASSE - BANK - DAY

NIKI is in a meeting with visibly concerned BANKERS and 
LAWYERS. They speak in German...

           BANKER
    Another loan? Herr Lauda, you still 
    haven’t repaid the other...

           BANKER 2
    Three..

           BANKER
    Totalling millions of Schillings. Plus 
    your Grandfather called to inform us 
    he will no longer be offering 
    security.

           NIKI
    I know. There is no room for failure. 
    I understand that. 

           NIKI
    But I was still a Lauda...

INT. NIKI’S CAR/ ROAD TO VIENNA AIRPORT - DAY

NIKI is driving his car. Beside him, is the attache case on 
his lap. His car passes under a motorway sign reading 
“Flughafen”. (Airport)...

           NIKI
    ...which meant I was still a 
    businessman above everything else. 

EXT. VIENNA AIRPORT - DAY

A private jet. A balding, blazered Englishman in late middle-
age (LOUIS STANLEY), owner of BRM racing, disembarks onto the 
tarmac...

           NIKI
    It just so happens that the business I 
    deal in is speed.

INT. VIENNA AIRPORT - CAFE

NIKI sits with LOUIS STANLEY in an airport cafe. 

Contracts are open on the table. NIKI is signing. LOUIS 
STANLEY is counter-signing...

           STANLEY
    In return for your money you get a 
    car, mechanics and a place on the 
    team. Plus fifty per cent of starting 
    fees and bonuses for podium finishes. 

           NIKI
    Who’s the number one driver?

           STANLEY
    Clay Regazzoni and you will defer to 
    him at all times. 

NIKI takes out his cheque book and pen. He looks up...

           NIKI
    Why would I defer to him if I am 
    paying his wages?

NIKI writes the cheque. STANLEY’s smile fades..

           STANLEY
    Because he’s a proven winner at the 
    highest level, a good guy, and someone 
    who quite frankly, could teach you a 
    thing or two.

NIKI ignores this, continues scrutinizing the contract...

           NIKI
    OK. There is one clause missing.

           STANLEY
    The one about mechanics’ exclusivity? 
    Sorry. We have a cardinal rule at BRM. 
    All information is shared between ALL 
    our drivers.. 

           NIKI
    And I made it perfectly clear that my 
    mechanics work for me. No one else. 
    This is something I cannot sign.

NIKI takes back the cheque. STANLEY stares...

           STANLEY
    All right. I’ll have the lawyers amend 
    it. 

           NIKI
    While you’re at it you can tell them 
    to amend the clause for podium 
    finishes. Podium is first THREE 
    places, not just wins.  

NIKI puts the cheque in his attache case. Snaps it shut, 
taking it with him..

           NIKI
    You’ll get the money on signature, as 
    agreed. See you at winter testing.

NIKI gets to his feet, and leaves. STANLEY watches the attache 
case disappear.

           STANLEY
    If that little git drives half as well 
    as he negotiates, we’re going to be 
    fine.

INT. AWARD CEREMONY - NIGHT

CUT TO:


An awards ceremony is in progress. The room is thick with 
cigar and cigarette smoke. A presenter on stage, wearing black 
tie...

           PRESENTER
    I’m delighted to say the winner of the 
    British Guild of Motoring Writers 
    award for the ‘Most Promising Driver 
    of the Year’ is James Hunt...

A loud, boisterous cheer goes up at the Hesketh Racing table. 

JAMES turns to a (new/different) girlfriend beside him, gives 
her a lingering kiss on the lips, then gets to his feet, 
shakes hands with HESKETH, and BUBBLES and skips up to the 
podium...

           JAMES
    Thank you. My parents always wanted me 
    to be a doctor, or stockbroker, and 
    gave me a first class education...but 
    to no avail. My brothers are the 
    success stories. I get bored easily. I 
    have a hot head, an inability to 
    tolerate discipline. I fall out with 
    people left and right. I’m quick to 
    settle matters with my fists. The only 
    creatures I’ve ever loved and treated 
    well, are budgerigars. In any normal 
    area of life, I’d be...or AM...a total 
    liability. All I’ve got going for me 
    is I’m quick in a car. 

A good-looking woman calls out..

           WOMAN
    That’s not all!

Laughter.

           JAMES
    So thank you for acknowledging that. 
    And giving me this...
       (indicating trophy)
    I’m going to give it to my Dad, and 
    tell him to put it on the mantle-piece 
    and imagine it’s a first class degree 
    in medicine. 

INT. AWARDS CEREMONY - LATER

Afterwards: everyone is celebrating. Thanks to JAMES, every 
pretty woman in the club is around. The trophy is perched 
beside bottles of champagne...

           HESKETH
    Well done, Superstar. One more season 
    in F2 then I’ll move you up. To the 
    big time. 

           JAMES
    You don’t think I’m ready now?

           HESKETH
    You are! I’m not! I’ve got to find you 
    a car first. And the money. The 
    economics of Formula 1 are terrifying. 

           BUBBLES
    Hurry up. You don’t want him to do 
    what Lauda did.

‘Pop’, HESKETH opens a bottle of champagne...

           BUBBLES 
    The Goosestepper. Remember him? 

JAMES makes the chicken noises again..

           BUBBLES
    Said he no longer wanted to risk his 
    life with “a bunch of crazy amateurs 
    and losers...”

           JAMES
    Is that what he called us?

           DOC
    Charming!

           HESKETH
    Nothing wrong with being an amateur!

           BUBBLES
    Said if he was going to risk his life, 
    he would only do so on the big 
    roulette table. Formula 1. So he got 
    himself a drive with BRM. 

           JAMES
    What? How? He never won a thing! Not a 
    single bloody race. 

           HESKETH
    Amateurs are what made this country 
    great. 

           BUBBLES
    Took out a loan, apparently. Paid for 
    it himself. 

           HESKETH
    “In war, as in lovemaking, amateurs 
    are invariably better than 
    professionals.” Napoleon Bonaparte.

           BUBBLES
    A hundred and fifty grand!

           JAMES
    A hundred and fifty grand? 

JAMES stares. Already sick with envy. 

           JAMES
    That’s either an act of utter lunacy, 
    or the ballsiest thing I ever heard.

CUT TO:

INT/EXT. RECEPTION PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - FRANCE - DAY

The PAUL RICARD circuit near Marseilles in the South of 
France. Where all winter training and testing is done.

NIKI arrives. An attractive woman (AGNES) greets him...

           NIKI
    Niki Lauda. Here for pre-season 
    testing. BRM?

           AGNES
    Take a seat, please. I’ll get someone 
    to come and collect you...

NIKI watches as she telephones the BRM workshops...

           AGNES
    Hi. There’s someone here for you?

           NIKI
       (prompting)
    Lauda.  

           AGNES
       (misunderstanding, speaking 
       louder)
    SOMEONE HERE TO SEE YOU.

She hangs up. NIKI decides against pointing out her mistake.    

           AGNES
    They’ll be right here.

           NIKI
    Thank you.

A silence. The RECEPTIONIST continues with her work. NIKI 
watches her, unsure what to say, (small-talk not his forte)...

           NIKI
    Worked here long?

           AGNES
    Excuse me?

           NIKI
    Just wondered if you’ve worked here 
    long?

           AGNES
    Almost eight years. 

           NIKI
    That long? And they didn’t promote you 
    yet?

           AGNES
    Yes, several times. I am the AGNES. 
    Agnes Bonnet. If you’re looking for 
    the receptionist, she’s on her lunch.

NIKI is thrown. Feels humiliated. A total jerk. He is about to 
say something when the door opens, and...

Two other F1 DRIVERS walk in..

Glamorous, long-haired, tanned, fashionable - like rock stars, 
they talk effortlessly and flirt confidently with AGNES.

What are you doing answering the phones? New haircut! Like it. 
What have you done to the weather? 

They make her laugh. And smile.

NIKI feels invisible. Embarrassed. Awkward. Inadequate. He 
gets to his feet. And goes to the car that has come to collect 
him. 

As he goes, (unseen by NIKI), AGNES watches him. Ignoring the 
other DRIVERS. Intrigued.

He’s different. Interesting. Intense. Intelligent eyes. 

EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - DAY

The car pulls up outside the workshops. NIKI gets out of the 
car, and is greeted by LOUIS STANLEY, and the BRM team...

           STANLEY
    Niki, let me introduce you to our 
    number 1 driver, Clay Regazzoni..and 
    our number 2, Jean Pierre Beltoise..

The intimidating, muscular, moustachioed figure of CLAY 
REGAZZONI, the Swiss driver. NIKI and CLAY shake hands. 

           STANLEY
    And these are your mechanics, 
    reporting exclusively to you. As per 
    contract...

REGAZZONI, BELTOISE and STANLEY exchange looks as NIKI shakes 
hands, ad-libbed greetings with his MECHANICS. 

           MECHANIC
    You want to see the car?

INT/EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - DAY

NIKI is led into the workshop to see a red and white Marlboro 
sponsored car, number 21, with a tall air-intake duct just 
above the driver’s helmet...

           MECHANIC
    There she is. The P160..

           NIKI
    Same as Regazzoni’s? 

           MECHANIC
    Identical in every detail. 

NIKI scrutinizes the car...

           NIKI
    She looks heavy. How much does she 
    weigh?

           MECHANIC
    540 kilos.

           NIKI
    That’s crazy. Why so heavy..?

           MECHANIC
    It’s a 3 litre, V12 engine, that thing 
    weighs 190k alone.

           NIKI
    What horsepower are you getting out of 
    it?

           MECHANIC
    450.

           NIKI
    Not enough. Needs to be 500 and the 
    engine needs to be 20k lighter.  

           MECHANIC
    We already tried...

           NIKI
    Did you use magnesium parts?

The MECHANICS look at one another skeptically...

INT. BRM WORKSHOPS - NIGHT

Shooting from above:

The entire car has been stripped to a thousand pieces. Now 
spread all over the workshop floor. 

NIKI’s team of mechanics reluctantly work through the night 
making the adjustments which NIKI is suggesting...

           NIKI
    Any solid plate, strip it out...

More disbelieving, skeptical looks. The car is in pieces on 
the floor. NIKI brews coffee to keep people alert. Focused.

           NIKI
    And when we’ve done that, we need to 
    look at the aerodynamics. Front and 
    rear wing..

More mutinous looks. “Who is this asshole?”

EXT. BRM WORKSHOPS - FIRST LIGHT

Daylight breaks over the race-track. The doors to the workshop 
open, and the MECHANICS and NIKI emerge - their work done.

NIKI goes to shake hands with the MECHANICS...

           NIKI
    OK. Thank you. Good night..

But they’re exhausted. Refuse to shake hands with this nut.

EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY

LATER: one of the BRM cars screams round the race-track...

NIKI watches on the sidelines as CLAY REGAZZONI is time-
testing his car. He walks over to where LOUIS STANLEY and 
several MECHANICS are doing the timings...

           NIKI
    What was his time?

           STANLEY
    Two minutes six seconds.

           NIKI
    OK. Now put him in my car, and he’ll 
    go round under two minutes.

           STANLEY
    Six seconds faster? Impossible.

NIKI looks up to see AGNES, the attractive TRACK MANAGER again 
on the other side of the track. 

NIKI waves hi. AGNES waves back. Smiles. NIKI raises his 
eyebrow. Surprised. 

EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY

REGAZZONI gets into NIKI’s car. 

EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY

REGAZZONI races round the track at full speed.

REGAZZONI roars past the finishing line in NIKI’s car. LOUIS 
STANLEY looks at the stop watch..

His expression changes.

INT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY

STANLEY comes into the workshop where NIKI and his MECHANICS 
are in conversation, getting changed...

           STANLEY
    All right. What did you do to the car?

           NIKI
    That’s information I will share with 
    you under certain conditions only.

STANLEY stares, bracing himself..

           STANLEY
    Go on...

           NIKI
    A guaranteed place in the team, and a 
    paid contract on equal terms with 
    Regazzoni for two years.

           STANLEY
    Are you crazy? Clay’s a senior figure 
    in Formula One...you’re a rookie. The 
    only reason we took you ON was because 
    you were paying us. 

           NIKI
    Well, as of now, if you want me to 
    stay, we rip up the contract. I don’t 
    pay you a cent.

           STANLEY
    It’s outrageous. 

           NIKI
    Was he quicker in my car? He was, 
    wasn’t he? 

STANLEY stares...

           NIKI
    Did he go under two minutes?

           STANLEY
       (quiet)
    One fifty-six.

           NIKI
    So have a think, work out your 
    priorities, and get back to me.

NIKI turns, and goes. STANLEY stares...

           STANLEY
    Not even my WIFE speaks to me like 
    that.

EXT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - DAY

CLAY REGAZZONI emerges from testing his car. Still amazed by 
the improved performance. Talking to his MECHANICS. In awe.

He removes his helmet, then stops. 

In the distance he sees NIKI talking to AGNES the attractive 
TRACK MANAGER. They are clearly hitting it off..

INT. PAUL RICARD CIRCUIT - WORKSHOPS - LOCKER-ROOM - DAY

NIKI is in the showers, then getting changed for his date with 
AGNES. He is about to go, when he stops, and sees...

CLAY REGAZZONI getting undressed, looking at NIKI. CLAY speaks 
English with an Italian accent..

           REGAZZONI
    I know what you’re going to say. That 
    it’s none of my business...

           NIKI
    What?

           REGAZZONI
    If it’s the Track Manager you’re 
    taking on your date tonight?

NIKI immediately becomes defensive...

           NIKI
    It’s none of your business.

           REGAZZONI
    Okay, but if you want my advice...I’d 
    let this one go. I’m not questioning 
    your taste. She’s a great girl. 

           REGAZZONI 
    But Agnes’s last boyfriend was a 
    British Formula 2 driver, who has a 
    reputation for two things. For being a 
    suicidal jerk on the track, and for 
    going all night, and all day 
    afterwards...and all night again in 
    bed. He’s an OK driver, but an 
    IMMORTAL fuck, apparently. I don’t 
    know about you, but that’s not an act 
    I’d like to follow. 
       (shrugs)
    But if that doesn’t bother you... 

           NIKI
    What’s his name? The driver?

           REGAZZONI
    Hunt. James Hunt.

NIKI stares. Can hardly believe it.

           REGAZZONI
    See? You share information, I share 
    information. 

CLAY slaps NIKI on his back, and goes into the showers..

           REGAZZONI
    That’s what team-mates are for.

           NIKI
       (quiet/defeated)
    Thanks.

EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

A restaurant in Marseilles. Through the window we can see 
AGNES, the attractive TRACK MANAGER sitting at a table alone. 
Waiting for NIKI. 

Reverse angle to reveal: 

INT. NIKI’S CAR/ MARSEILLES STREET - SAME TIME

NIKI is sitting in a car across the street. He stares at AGNES 
in the restaurant. Then starts his car, and drives off. 

FADE TO BLACK:

EXT. EASTON NESTON - HESKETH RACING HQ - DAY

Easton Neston. Set in 3,300 acres, one of England’s great 
country houses. Home to the Fermor-Hesketh family since 1700.

JAMES and a new GIRLFRIEND drive up the gravel drive in his 
anything but grandiose Mini. It splutters to a stop, just in 
time.

They are greeted by uniformed STAFF who take his tatty bags 
from his filthy car. 

INT. HESKETH RACING WORKSHOPS - EASTON NESTON - DAY

The Hesketh Racing workshops, situated in the converted 
stables on the estate. HESKETH leads a blindfolded JAMES in...

           HESKETH
    Keep them closed...! Wait for it, wait 
    for it...

HESKETH removes JAMES’s blindfold...

           HESKETH
    There! What do you say?

JAMES opens his eyes to see a gorgeous F1 racing car, plain 
white, no stickers...

           HESKETH
    Isn’t she a beauty? The March 731. 
    Converted by the brilliant Doc..!

DOC POSTLETHWAITE takes a modest bow. JAMES shakes hands with 
everyone, including his brother, (and manager), PETER..

           JAMES
    She is a beauty. But...haven’t you 
    made a mistake?

           HESKETH
    What?

           JAMES
    That’s not a Formula 2 car. She’s F1.

           HESKETH
    She is, Superstar. Why? Because I got 
    together with the beancounters, and it 
    turns out that the economics of F1 are 
    not so significantly different to the 
    economics of Formula 2...

BUBBLES clears his throat, dutifully bites his tongue..

           HESKETH
    So we thought if we were going to be 
    messing about losing money we might as 
    well be doing it with the big boys.  

           JAMES
    Are you serious?

           HESKETH
    Never been more serious in my life! 

JAMES embraces HESKETH in excitement, kisses him...

           HESKETH
    Actually, I got the idea after what 
    you said about the Austrian chap who 
    bought his way in rather than waste 
    his time in the lower divisions. I 
    thought, “Bloody hell, he’s right!”

JAMES slips into the cockpit...

           JAMES
    Well done the Goosestepper!!

           HESKETH
       (indicates car)
    No sponsorship, Superstar! I hope you 
    approve. 

           JAMES
    I do, Patron.

           HESKETH
    No vulgar logos for cigarettes, or 
    condoms. Just plain white. With the 
    Union Jack. And racing overalls which 
    read... 

HESKETH indicates JAMES’s hanging racing overalls...

           HESKETH
    “Sex. Breakfast of Champions.” Unless 
    it’s me, of course, in which case it’s 
    two kippers, porridge, boiled eggs, 
    and half a dozen slices of toast...

Laughter.

           JAMES
    So when do we start?

           HESKETH
    Soon as you’re ready.

           JAMES
    I’m ready now. 

           HESKETH
    That’s my boy! 

HESKETH pops champagne...

           HESKETH
    They won’t know what’s hit them!

EXT. SPANISH GP - RACE TRACK -27 APRIL 1975- DAY

To establish: a Formula 1 race track on Grand Prix week-end..

A helicopter comes in to land.

The Hesketh Racing Team makes a grand entrance with a retinue 
of BUTLERS, GIRLS, ROLLS’ ROYCE’s, oysters, champagne...

A famous ex-champion TV REPORTER is there (Stirling Moss) 
providing skeptical commentary about Hesketh’s debut... 

           STIRLING MOSS
    ...hard to tell whether Lord Hesketh 
    and his team of upper class 
    enthusiasts is bringing glamour to the 
    racing community, or just comedy...

They walk around in their own branded clothing. Alexander’s 
jacket reads, “Le Patron”. He speaks to MOSS.

Rolled eyes among other racing teams who express surprise, 
curiosity (and frequently disapproval) at these new arrivals..

           STIRLING MOSS
    It’s certainly the first time I can 
    remember seeing a butler serving 
    caviar and oysters in the pits...

Suddenly pandemonium breaks out. Screams. Something has 
happened. A bad accident on the track. During testing...

           STIRLING MOSS
       (holding ear-piece)
    ...reports are reaching me of a 
    serious accident that has just taken 
    place in qualifying....

All smiles fade. The party atmosphere changes in a flash. 
Panic breaks out. 

The sound of sirens. Ambulances rushing to the scene of the 
accident. All the JOURNALISTS and TV CREWS rush off, too. 

HESKETH, BUBBLES and JAMES look at one another, put down their 
champagne glasses, and follow... 

EXT. RACE TRACK - SPAIN - DAY

Mangled wreckage. A car has crashed into (badly installed) 
Armco guard rails, splitting the railing in two...

The DRIVER has been decapitated. His helmeted HEAD lies 
cleanly severed on the ground...

A goldfish-bowl of blood. 

It’s a horrific accident. People SCREAM and look away. Even 
hardened medical professionals... 

JAMES, HESKETH, BUBBLES arrive on the scene of the accident. 
But they are kept away, at a distance...

           STIRLING MOSS
    ...it seems the driver...just twenty-
    six years old....was killed on 
    impact...and the death toll in Formula 
    1 shows no sign of slowing down... 

INT. HESKETH PITS - SPANISH GRAND PRIX - DAY

JAMES, dressed in his overalls, is violently retching. Sick 
with nerves. A TV plays in the pits...

           COMMENTATOR
    ...in the last five years alone 
    Formula 1 has lost Piers Courage, Jo 
    Siffert, Peter Revson, Jochen Rindt, 
    Francois Cevert, Roger Williamson...

ON TV: quickfire clips of the terrible, violent deaths. 
BUBBLES hastily switches off the TV as JAMES walks past...

EXT. PADDOCK - DAY

JAMES walks out of the paddock, towards his car. Other DRIVERS 
gathered in concerned groups, talking...

           DRIVER 
    It’s terrible. 

           JAMES
    They should cancel the race.

Then, a distinctive Austrian accent..

           NIKI
    Why? No one came to see him anyway.
    He made a mistake. Went into the 
    corner too fast. 

           JAMES
    Is that right? So says the nobody who 
    had to pay for his own drive. How’s 
    that working out, by the way?

           NIKI
    Fine. How’s it at the back? 

           JAMES
    Not planning on being there for long.

           NIKI
    Good. Look forward to you showing me 
    the way today.

           JAMES
    ‘Be happy to. I’ll have you inside lap 
    one. 

           NIKI
    Yeah right.

JAMES walks off to his car, shaking his head.. 

           JAMES
    Asshole.

NIKI walks to his car, putting on his helmet.

           NIKI
    Asshole.

EXT. SPANISH GRAND PRIX PADDOCK/ PODIUM - DAY

NIKI is on the podium, spraying champagne. He is wearing the 
victor’s garland...

Meanwhile: JAMES’s car is embarrassingly being brought back by 
a tow-truck. NIKI watches from the podium..

His eyes meet JAMES’s..

INT. BAR - HOTEL - NIGHT


JAMES and BUBBLES and PETER HUNT (JAMES’s blazer-wearing 
manager and elder brother), sit together at a table in the 
corner. It’s late. A frank post-mortem. Drinking and talking..

           JAMES
    Niki humiliated me today. He lapped me 
    three times. 

           BUBBLES
    He lapped Carlos Pace six times.

           JAMES
    That’s supposed to console me? What do 
    I need to do? 

           PETER
    Grow up.

           JAMES
    Shut up, Moneyman. ‘Didn’t ask you..

           BUBBLES
    Your brother’s right. You’ve got to 
    change your attitude. We all do. And 
    match it with a whole different mental 
    approach. Professionalism. Maturity. 
    Like Niki. 

           PETER
    Bet he doesn’t go out every night, 
    drink and screw himself stupid. 

           JAMES
    So speaks the jealous married man..

           PETER
    No. So speaks the manager who’s 
    wasting his time, making ten per cent 
    of absolutely nothing.

           BUBBLES
    You’ve just got to take it more 
    seriously. Yourself more seriously. 

           PETER
    Something he’s never done.

           JAMES
    Don‘t patronize me, Pete...

           BUBBLES
    We need you to spend less time in bars 
    and nightclubs...

           PETER
    Make that NO time...

           BUBBLES
    And more time with the mechanics, 
    setting up the car. That’s what Lauda 
    does. 24 hours a day. 

JAMES rolls his eyes...

           BUBBLES
    God knows there’s nothing wrong with 
    your talent. Or courage. It’s purely a 
    character issue right now.

           JAMES
    And the good news is I’ve got Sigmund 
    Freud Horsely, failed driver par 
    excellence, and a washed-up accountant 
    to lecture me on it.

           PETER
       (closes eyes)
    Jesus, James...

BUBBLES walks off. PETER HUNT walks off. JAMES calls out..

           JAMES
    Bubbles? I’m sorry..! I didn’t mean 
    that! Come back..!

EXT. EASTON NESTON - DAY

The grand Hesketh estate in the Northamptonshire countryside.

INT. HESKETH RACING WORKSHOPS - EASTON NESTON - DAY

JAMES is in the workshops, his hands and arms filthy, he’s 
been working on the car - but now his eyes are closed. 
Memorizing tracks. Around him people are working on the car.. 

           JAMES
    ....along the Beau Rivage, long left 
    into Massenet, into the short right of 
    Casino. Sharp right into Mirabeau, 
    then sharp left into Loews, mind the 
    guard rails...

           VOICE
    Is Alexander around..?

JAMES opens his eyes to see an endless pair of legs, a drop-
dead gorgeous figure, and the beautiful smiling face of SUZY 
MILLER, the most successful model of the day.

           JAMES
    He was. Then went to the house to take 
    a call. He’ll be back shortly. 

           SUZY
    Only he wanted to show off his pride 
    and joy...

SUZY indicates the car...

           SUZY
    ...rhymes with ‘boy’ if you ask me. 
    And ‘toy’. I can’t believe what I’m 
    seeing. 

           JAMES
    Why?

           SUZY
    It’s just so small! For something that 
    costs so much. And so flimsy. There’s 
    no comfort. No protection. Nothing.

           JAMES
    No. Just a little coffin, surrounded 
    by high-octane fuel, being driven 
    round at 170 miles per hour..

           JAMES 
       (becoming grave)
    To all intents and purposes a bomb. On 
    wheels.  

           SUZY
    Why don’t they make it safer?

           JAMES
    No one wants it to be. It’s like 
    saying why not make bullfighting 
    safer? It’s a blood sport. The risk of 
    death turns people on. Without it, I 
    guess, it’d be half the fun. Which is 
    fine for the voyeurs, fine for TV, 
    fine for everyone..
       (a beat)
    ...except us drivers.

SUZY looks JAMES up and down. Sees the bare feet, the rock 
star good looks...

           SUZY
    You’re James, aren’t you? 

           JAMES
    Yes.

           SUZY
    Thought so. You fit the description.
       (shaking hands)
    Suzy. Friend of Alex’s. 

           JAMES
    I know exactly.

In the background: one of the MECHANICS shows DOC a picture of 
SUZY from a tabloid newspaper. She’s clearly the most famous 
model in Britain, and a star in her own right... 

           JAMES
    What was the description?

           SUZY
    Mostly positive in terms of 
    appearance. Negative only in terms of 
    character. I’ve been told to avoid 
    you.

           JAMES
    By whom?

           SUZY
    Alex. He says you’re a bad boy.

           JAMES
    Was. Not any more. New me very 
    professional. Early to bed. Early to 
    rise. All very dull.

           SUZY
    Really?

           JAMES
    Round-the-clock work, practise and 
    focus. Tedious, but apparently the 
    only way to vin against ze 
    Goosestepper..

           SUZY
    Is that what you were doing when you 
    came in?

           JAMES
    Visualization techniques. Memorizing 
    the circuit, in this case Monaco, 
    which is next up. Eyes closed, know 
    your way round in your sleep...
       (a beat)
    I know...I’ve always been a great 
    believer in getting there on the day, 
    putting the old foot down and playing 
    chicken with everyone else. 

SUZY laughs..

           JAMES
    But they don’t want me to do that 
    anymore...they want my body like a 
    temple. My mind like Monk.

           SUZY
    And your soul? Your heart? 

           JAMES
    What does that mean?

           SUZY
    You can’t be so disciplined in all 
    areas of your life, can you..?

           JAMES
    They want me to stop messing around, 
    get married and settle down with the 
    next nice girl I meet. They think it 
    would be good for me.

           SUZY
    What do you think?

           JAMES
    Sounds bloody awful.

SUZY laughs again...

           JAMES
    But since they’re right about most 
    things, they’re probably right about 
    that, too.

JAMES looks SUZY up and down...

           JAMES
    You don’t fancy getting married, do 
    you?

EXT. BROMPTON ORATORY CHURCH - LONDON - DAY

The sound of ringing bells. London’s grandest Catholic church 
in the heart of Knightsbridge..

EXT. BROMPTON ORATORY CHURCH - DAY

JAMES and SUZY, top hat and tails, flowing white wedding 
dress, looking ravishing, emerge from the church. 

JAMES and SUZY fall into a passionate, sexy embrace for the 
paparazzi cameras. Loud cheers go up, led by HESKETH and 
BUBBLES.

They make their way to the waiting convoy of cars...

On his way: JAMES spots a serious-faced HESKETH and DOC 
POSTLETHWAITE in conversation with some Formula 1 types in the 
crowd..

SUZY is pulled away for photos. Clearly a bigger star even 
than JAMES. JAMES turns to BUBBLES, indicates HESKETH...

           JAMES
    What’s up?

           BUBBLES
    Nothing. I don’t want to ruin your 
    day.

BUBBLES stares, then reluctantly...

           BUBBLES
    It seems your revenge against the 
    Goosestepper might have to wait a 
    little longer than you’d hoped.
       (a beat)
    He’s just been signed by Ferrari.

           JAMES
    WHAT??? But that’s the best team in 
    the world. They could have ANYONE. Did 
    he pay his way in there, too?

           BUBBLES
    Apparently they took back Regazzoni 
    and he insisted they give Lauda a 
    trial. Thinks he’s a genius. Setting 
    up the cars... 

JAMES stares...then is pulled away to pose in photographs with 
SUZY and her FAMILY. 

EXT. FIORANO - NORTHERN ITALY - DAY

FERRARI’s state-of-the-art practise facilities and private 
test-track in Northern Italy.

INT. FERRARI CONTROL ROOM

Closed circuit television, with 10 cameras and a complex track 
timing system and computers....

EXT. FIORANO - TRACK SIDE


ENZO FERRARI himself, the Commendatore, a formidable white-
haired patriarch in Onassis dark glasses, reads newspapers, 
sitting by the race tracks, barely looking up as two red 
Ferrari’s roar round the track...

LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO, the young, dynamic, aristocratic manager 
of the Scuderia, by contrast, watches eagle-eyed..

EXT. FIORANO - TRACKSIDE - LATER

The two cars stop, and NIKI and CLAY REGAZZONI gets out. NIKI 
talks (in a mix of Italian and English) to his MECHANIC, 
giving them typically blunt feedback...

           NIKI
    It’s terrible! Drives like a pig! 

           MECHANIC
    Sssshhh! You can’t say that!

           NIKI

    Why not?

           MECHANIC
    It’s a Ferrari!

           NIKI
    I’ve driven better milk floats. It 
    understeers like crazy and the weight 
    distribution is a disaster... 

The MECHANIC gulps, then walks over to where the terrifying 
COMMENDATORE and LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO are sitting, and passes 
on the information...

           MECHANIC
    He says the car is magnificent, a 
    masterpiece, but he has suggestions 
    for one or two minor refinements...

INT. FERRARI PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY

A large press conference, with motoring JOURNALISTS and 
television CREWS from all over the world attending...

ENZO FERRARI and LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO addresses the conference 
(in Italian) which is translated by a translator...

           ENZO
    We are happy to welcome back to the 
    Ferrari family our good friend, Clay 
    Regazzoni...and also to introduce, 
    from Austria Niki Lauda..

A burst of flash photography. NIKI and REGAZZONI sit side by 
side.

EXT. ITALIAN COUNTRY ROADS - DAY

A car drives fast on country roads in Northern Italy...

INT. CAR - SAME TIME

CLAY REGAZZONI is driving, NIKI is in the passenger seat...

           REGAZZONI
    “Ferrari Family”. “Our good friend, 
    Clay Regazzoni”. 

           REGAZZONI 
    You’re friend and family to the 
    Commendatore as long as you win. The 
    minute you don’t..
       (mimes execution)

           NIKI
    I understand. It’s business. I would 
    be the same.

           REGAZZONI
    But it isn’t just business, is it? 
    What we do? It’s passion. Love. Which 
    is why we’re prepared to risk our 
    lives for it.  

           NIKI
    Not me. If I thought I had more talent 
    and could earn better money doing 
    something else, I would. 

           REGAZZONI
    But how do you know you will make 
    money here? You haven’t yet.

           NIKI
    Not yet. But I will. 
       (smiles)
    If you can, I can.  

REGAZZONI shakes his head, can’t help smiling...

           REGAZZONI
    You know, are you ever NOT an asshole?

NIKI laughs...

           NIKI
    Why am I an asshole? You know by now 
    I’m both quicker than you and better 
    at setting up the car. You can’t deal 
    with that, then you’re the asshole. 

           REGAZZONI
    Screw you. 

REGAZZONI pulls up outside the house...

           REGAZZONI 
    I brought you along today because you 
    seem like a lonely kind of guy. I 
    thought if I introduce you to some 
    nice people, it’d be good for you. 
    Forget it. Make your own friends.


REGAZZONI walks ahead, disappears through the front door, 
where he is warmly welcomed, and invited into a party.

NIKI calls after him...

           NIKI
    I’m sorry. C’mon, Clay...

EXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - NORTHERN ITALY - DAY

NIKI stares through the window. Inside: a very appealing 
looking bunch - young, good-looking, cool, sexy GUESTS - all 
having a good time..

By contrast: NIKI catches his own reflection in the glass 
reflection. Pale. Intense. The outsider.  

Inside: REGAZZONI is surrounded by friends, telling a story. 
Everyone laughs. 

NIKI watches. Then turns to walk away. As he goes, the front 
door opens...

And a beautiful dark-haired woman (MARLENE) emerges loading 
several BAGS into a car. Brunette, tan. Wearing a white dress.

           NIKI
    Are you leaving? 

           MARLENE
    Yes. 

           NIKI
    Can you give me a lift to the nearest 
    town? Anywhere with a train station.

           MARLENE
    Sure. Nearest town is half an hour’s 
    drive. Get in.

EXT. ROAD - DAY

The car drives. The radio plays. Marlene sings along. NIKI 
can’t help noticing something. He turns down the music. 
MARLENE’s smile fades..

           MARLENE
    What are you doing? 


           NIKI
    You hear that noise when you  
    accelerate?

           MARLENE
    No. 

           NIKI
    Your drive belt is loose. 

           MARLENE
    My what?

           NIKI
    Alternator. And when you brake, your 
    foot goes all the way down. Means 
    there’s air in the system. 

           MARLENE
    Anything else?

           NIKI
    No. Apart from the rear brakes are 
    imbalanced. The front right wheel is 
    flat, and it feels like a crack in the 
    engine block...which explains why 
    you’re drifting so much. 

           MARLENE
    How can you tell?

           NIKI
   My ass.

           MARLENE
     What?

           NIKI
    God gave me an OK mind, but a really 
    good ass, which can feel everything in 
    a car. 

           MARLENE
    You don’t know what you’re talking 
    about. The car is fine. And it just 
    had a service a week ago.

           NIKI
    Not a good one.

           MARLENE
    A very good one. From a proper garage. 
    It cost a fortune. This car is good as 
    new. Relax.

EXT. MOTORWAY - HARD SHOULDER - DAY

White smoke pours from the engine. The car has broken down. 
Bonnet up. NIKI has tried fixing it, but to no avail. 

NIKI has a fan belt in his hand, but it’s all but 
disintegrated under the heat of the over-worked engine.

NIKI’s hands are covered in oil. He is pushing a pen into a 
large crack in the engine, slick with oil and grease.

           NIKI
    Nothing I can do here. The car needs a 
    garage. 

           MARLENE
    I’m sorry. You’re not in a hurry, are 
    you?

           NIKI
    No. As long as I’m back in Maranello 
    by Monday morning.

NIKI walks out into the road. Sticks out his thumb...

           MARLENE
    So who are you anyway? 

MARLENE breaks into GERMAN...(we see sub-titles)...

           MARLENE
    You’re from Vienna, aren’t you. We can 
    speak German. How do you know Curd? 

           NIKI
    Who’s Curd?

           MARLENE
    Curd Jurgens. The actor. It’s his 
    house. He is, or was until yesterday, 
    my boyfriend. I must have been mad! 
    There is something very attractive 
    about an older man when they behave 
    like one. But when they behave like a 
    frightened child.. 

MARLENE gets to her feet...

           MARLENE
    C’mon, let me do this. Otherwise we’ll 
    never get out of here. We’re in Italy, 
    after all. 

MARLENE indicates that NIKI should take a back seat, hitches 
up her skirt, showing long, tanned legs..

SSSCCCREEEEEEEEECCCCCHHHHHHH!!!!!

Immediately a passing car screeches to a halt, then reverses 
noisily to pull level. MARLENE smiles at NIKI...

           MARLENE
    Not bad, eh? Three seconds. Admit it, 
    you’re impressed..!

MARLENE smiles flirtatiously at the handsome, young Italian 
MEN driving the open-topped sports car..

           MARLENE
    Ciao, Regazzi...!

But the Italian MEN walk right past her, not seeing her, as if 
she’s invisible, and stare at NIKI...

           ITALIAN MAN
       (in Italian)
    Excuse me...are you Niki Lauda?

           NIKI
    Yes.

           ITALIAN MAN
       (in Italian)
    Oh, my God...!!! I told you it was 
    him..!!!
       (blown away)
    Do you need a ride?

           NIKI
    Yes, we do...

The ITALIAN MAN gestures to his car, as his friend loads 
MARLENE’s luggage inside...

           ITALIAN MAN
    An honour, please!!! But on one 
    condition..

The ITALIAN MAN whisper in NIKI’s ear. MARLENE stares, not 
understanding, as NIKI protests, but then slowly, reluctantly 
gets into the car. He starts the engine.  

MARLENE watches as the ITALIAN MEN strap themselves in with 
the seat-belts, tightening them...giggling like schoolboys..

           MARLENE
    Will someone please tell me what’s 
    going on?

MARLENE turns to NIKI...

           MARLENE
    Who are you, anyway? What do you DO?

           ITALIAN MAN
    You don’t know? He’s a Formula I 
    driver. Who just signed for Ferrari!

           MARLENE
    Him? Never. Impossible! 

           ITALIAN MAN
    Why?

           MARLENE
    Formula 1 drivers have long hair, are 
    sexy, have shirts open to here..

MARLENE indicates...

           MARLENE
    Anyway, look at the way he’s driving!! 
    Like an old man!! 

It’s true. NIKI is driving in the slow lane. Like a pensioner.

           NIKI
    No need to drive fast. It only 
    increases the percentage of risk. 
    We’re not in a hurry. No one is paying 
    me. Right now, with zero incentive or 
    reward, why would I drive fast? 

MARLENE looks at him with her dark green eyes...

           MARLENE
       (in German)
    Because I’m asking you to.

           NIKI
       (in German)
    And do you always get what you want?

           MARLENE
       (in German)
    Usually.

NIKI stares, trying to resist...but cannot. He does a  
lightning double-declutch...

“SLAM”, NIKI’s foot hits the floor, the engine screams, the 
rev counter flies to the right...

And the open-topped sports car lurches into warp-drive...

MARLENE is thrown back hard in her seat, “Jesus”, her eyes 
widen in terror and amazement..

           MARLENE
    Oh, my God...!!

The ITALIAN MEN scream in excitement, holding on for dear life 
as NIKI, his heart not a beat over 60, takes the car to 
breaking point, in a way it’s never been driven before...

NIKI overtakes everyone on the motorway, fearlessly weaving 
between cars at twice their speed..

We CLOSE on NIKI’s eyes, remaining dead calm as his passengers 
scream all around him, as he accelerates through the other 
cars on the motorway...

His EYES remain calm, his WHEELS a blur of speed, and we...

MATCH CUT TO:

EXT. USA GP - WATKINS GLEN - 5TH OCTOBER 1975 - TRACK - DAY

Calm EYES, and WHEELS moving in a blur of speed. We’re in the 
middle of a Grand Prix, and NIKI is driving at the limit...

CAPTION: “1975”.

Ahead of him: a familiar sight. The back of JAMES HUNT’s 
Hesketh..

EXT. PITS - DAY

MARLENE watches on TV in the pits as NIKI is engaged in an 
epic tussle with JAMES...

Commentators note the improvement in JAMES’s technique, 
maturity and performance. But then, “Puff”, a plume of smoke 
comes out of JAMES’s engine. The engine has blown...

Immediately JAMES loses speed, and NIKI sails past, overtaking 
effortlessly. Taking the chequered flag.

Television commentary in various languages tells us: NIKI 
LAUDA has become world champion...

EXT. FERRARI PITS/USA GP TRACK SIDE - DAY

NIKI’s car pulls in, to be mobbed by jubilant MECHANICS as he 
gets out of his car, removing his helmet, embraced by a 
delighted LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO...

...then falling into a passionate kiss with MARLENE...

Champion of the World, he is immediately swallowed up by 
REPORTERS who are demanding interviews in Italian, German, 
English...

EXT. USA GP/PADDOCK - DAY

An impromptu party in the paddock area. The victor’s garland 
still round his neck, proudly holding the FIA World Champion 
trophy, his hair matted with champagne, NIKI passes through 
the crowds, accepting everyone’s congratulations..

He runs into JAMES, who’s in bare feet as usual. MARLENE is 
pulled away to talk to someone else..

           JAMES
    Congratulations. 

           NIKI
    Thank you.

           JAMES
    Though with a car like that, the rest 
    of us never stood a chance...

           NIKI
    Maybe the fact the car is so good  
    might have something to do with me.

           JAMES
    You’re still in a Ferrari. And I’m 
    still in a Hesketh. On equal terms, 
    the way it was in Formula 3, I’d beat 
    you, and you know it.

           NIKI
    Never. You might get lucky and win one 
    race. Maybe two. Because you’re 
    aggressive. But in the long run, over 
    the course of a season, no chance. 

           JAMES
    Why’s that?

           NIKI
    Because you’re not serious. You’re 
    just a party guy. Which is why 
    everyone likes you. 

           JAMES
    Now try saying that and tell me you’re 
    not jealous.

           NIKI
    But all that affection, all those 
    smiles is also a sign of their 
    disrespect! They don’t fear you. 
    Whereas compare that to me...

           JAMES
    Whom no one likes...

           NIKI
    Right..

           JAMES
    Not even his own team-mates..

           NIKI
    Right! Because I’m relentless. I don’t 
    screw up. I go to bed early. I look 
    after myself, look after my car. And 
    then, soon as the race is finished, I 
    go home. You should go home more 
    often, too. I heard you got married.

           JAMES
    I did.

           NIKI
    So where is she? 

           JAMES
    In New York. Working. 

           NIKI
    You know I’ve never seen you with her, 
    once...

NIKI turns to MARLENE, “Let’s go”..

EXT. EASTON NESTON - DAY

JAMES’s Mini roars furiously up the long gravel driveway 
towards Easton Neston. Screeches to a halt.

JAMES gets out of the car. Is greeted by staff, whom he 
uncharacteristically ignores, storming past...

INT. EASTON NESTON - WORKSHOP - DAY

JAMES walks into the workshops where BUBBLES HORSLEY is busy 
doing something...

           JAMES
    Right, whatever it takes to beat 
    Lauda, just say it, your word is my 
    command. I’ll do it. There are no 
    lengths to which I will not go. And I 
    mean it this time...

JAMES stops, noticing BUBBLES’s expression...

           JAMES
    What’s the matter?

Then JAMES notices what BUBBLES is doing. He’s packing.

           JAMES
    What are you doing?

Then JAMES notices the lack of activity in the workshops. None 
of the usual mechanics, or engineers..

           JAMES
    Where is everyone?

BUBBLES looks up. Unsure how to break it to him.

INT. DRAWING-ROOM - EASTON NESTON - DAY

An old drawing-room. The open fire roars. But HESKETH is 
uncharacteristically quiet. Defeated..

           HESKETH
    Do you know what the date is today?

           JAMES
    November 14th.

           HESKETH
    Do you have any idea of the 
    significance of that date? 

           JAMES
    I’m assuming it refers to some animal 
    you are allowed or no longer allowed 
    to slaughter on your estate.

           HESKETH
    Actually it’s the deadline for 
    securing sponsorship for the 
    forthcoming Formula 1 season. 
       (a beat)
    Which elapsed at midnight last night. 
    And we didn’t attract any.

           JAMES
    So? We aren’t looking for sponsorship. 
    Condoms and cigarettes. Vulgar, right?

           HESKETH
    Right. Except we are. Or were. I’ve 
    made something of a miscalculation. 
    The economics. Formula 1. Reality 
    thereof. Turns out not like the lower 
    divisions at all.

           JAMES
    What are you saying?

           HESKETH
    I’m saying it’s over, Superstar. The 
    banks have stepped in. Read me the 
    riot act. Started laying everyone off. 
    Probably have to sell this place. Fun 
    while it lasted, would do it all again 
    and all that... 
       (ashen)
    I daren’t tell you the actual figures. 

JAMES stares at a devastated HESKETH...

           JAMES
    Christ.

INT. JAMES’S FLAT - LONDON - NIGHT

JAMES is on the phone to his brother PETER, while playing 
Scale-electrix cars on a track alone, barefoot...

           JAMES
    I need a drive, Pete. Need you to find 
    me a drive.
       (listens)
    What does that mean? “My reputation 
    precedes me?” 

“Crash”, the electric toy car crashes...

           JAMES
       (listens)
    Really? Is that what they said?
       (a beat)
    Did they at least say a “Quick 
    arsehole?”
       (listens)
    Bollocks to Lotus. Find me someone 
    else. I’ll go mad otherwise.

“Click”, JAMES hangs up. SUZY walks in. Sees his mood..

           SUZY
    Don’t worry. Something will turn up.

JAMES opens a bottle of Scotch, pours himself a drink...

           SUZY
    But I doubt that will help in the 
    meantime.

JAMES knocks back the drink...

           SUZY
    Why don’t we go away for the week-end? 
    Before I leave again for New York? 

JAMES carries on drinking..

           SUZY
    Talk to me, James. Don’t make a 
    stranger of me.

JAMES doesn’t react...

           SUZY
    I can’t watch this.

SUZY picks up her coat, and bag..

           JAMES
    What were you hoping for? A well-
    adjusted knight in shining armour?

           SUZY
    No danger of that....

           JAMES
    Let me give you some advice. 

           SUZY
    I’m all ears... 

           JAMES
    Don’t go to men who are willing to 
    kill themselves driving in circles 
    looking for normality. 

           SUZY
    Well, I certainly didn’t get that...

           JAMES
    Should have gone for one of my 
    brothers. 

           SUZY
    There goes that self-pity again. 
    How striking it is -

           JAMES
    What’s that? Tell me.. 

           SUZY
    The gulf between appearance and 
    reality. Look at you, all sunshine 
    blonde beauty and smiles...yet the 
    reality is...a frightened, immature, 
    depressed, self-pitying child...

           JAMES
    At least there’s SOMETHING behind the 
    facade. 

           SUZY
    With a nasty temper..

           JAMES
    Fuck off to New York, dear. There must 
    be a moisturizer or eye shadow 
    somewhere that needs your vapid mush 
    to flog it.  

           SUZY
    How quickly beauty can turn ugly. 

           JAMES
    Agreed. Repellent.

SUZY stares...and goes. JAMES carries on drinking.

INT. JAMES’S FLAT - FOLLOWING MORNING

The following morning. The phone rings. Piercing the darkness. 
JAMES, clearly the worse for wear, is talking to his beloved 
budgies...

           JAMES
    Good girl...

A surprising vulnerability, and childlike innocence about 
JAMES. He strokes the birds with real tenderness..

The phone continues ringing. JAMES picks it up...

           JAMES (INTO PHONE)
    Hello?

JAMES listens, then hears something on the phone that makes 
him sit up...

           JAMES (INTO PHONE)
    Who? McLaren?

JAMES is waking rapidly now..

           JAMES (INTO PHONE)
    Just get me in a room with them, Pete. 
    Say anything. Today? Yes, I can do 
    today. 
       (checks watch)
    I can be there in an hour.

JAMES starts scribbling down the address. 

EXT. MCLAREN HQ - TO ESTABLISH

The headquarters of McLaren Racing in Colnbrook, Bucks. 

A small, unassuming building on the Poyle Trading Estate. Bare 
brickwork surrounds a brash yellow facade, with the words 
‘MCLAREN RACING’ in large white letters. 

INT. MCLAREN HQ - BOARDROOM - DAY

A large boardroom. Team Director TEDDY MAYER (American, from 
Pennsylvania, short, lawyerly, 50’s - hair turning grey) sits 
at the head of the table.

Next to him is Aussie Marlboro spokesman JOHN HOGAN and 
McLaren Team Manager and chief mechanic ALASTAIR CALDWELL. 

The atmosphere is tense, uncomfortable...

           MAYER
    I’ll come straight to the point. Our 
    esteemed lead driver...

           CALDWELL
    Fitti-fucking-paldi..

           MAYER
    Has ditched us for another team at the 
    last minute..

           CALDWELL
    In November. Fucking outrageous.


           MAYER
    And we need a replacement. Asap. 
    Thankfully a few hands have already 
    gone up. Good people... 

           CALDWELL
    Like Jackie Ickx. 

           JAMES
    I’m quicker than Jackie.

           MAYER
    But he’s consistent, dependable. 
    Sponsor friendly. He’ll dress up nice. 
    Say the right things.

           JAMES
    What do you want? A driver or a 
    brushes salesman? 

           MAYER
    We want to be successful. 

           JAMES
    So do I. But I measure that in podium 
    finishes and beating Niki Lauda not 
    being a show pony for sponsors. 

           MAYER
    I’ve heard about this thing with 
    Lauda. 

           CALDWELL
       (rolls eyes)
    Everyone has..

           MAYER
    You really think you can beat him? 
    He’s World Champion.

           JAMES
    I beat him in Formula 3. 

           CALDWELL
    This season alone he’s had eight 
    podiums, five wins, you’ve had what?

           HOGAN
    One.

           JAMES
    Only because I’ve been in the wrong 
    car. I beat him when the playing field 
    was level. I’d beat him again in a 
    McLaren. 

           JAMES 
    It’s the only car out there as good as 
    the Ferrari. Which is why I’m here, 
    begging.

JAMES stares imploringly..

           JAMES
    I’ll do whatever you ask. Even put on 
    a suit, talk to sponsors and say the 
    right thing. I promise. 
       (a beat)
    Just give me the drive...

CALDWELL, HOGAN and MAYER look at one another...

Crowds flood to the spectator stands. The pit lane stretches

           COMMENTATOR
    ...that Britain’s James Hunt in his 
    first race for Mclaren has qualified 
    fastest, beating Niki Lauda’s Ferrari 
    to pole by two hundredths of a second. 
    In the crowds to watch the race none

    Level playing field now, my ratty 
    little friend.

           NIKI
    Let’s see where we are at the end of 
    lap one.

NIKI calls after JAMES as he walks to his car...

    Let’s see where we are in six races 
    time!!

JAMES turns, makes a ratty face at NIKI. Protruding teeth.

There it is. The deep, dark, sonorous Welsh baritone 
voice...scarred by alcohol and cigarettes...

           SUZY
    James Hunt. One of the racers.

           BURTON

He indicates LIZ who is deeply bored..

    Five eighths of an inch..!

    Which makes it illegal! If you want to 
    compete, you have to change it.

           JAMES
    What? You can’t just ‘change it’. That 
    means rebuilding the car. Who lodged 
    the complaint? It was Ferrari, wasn’t 
    it?

EXT. BELGIUM GP 1976 - ZOLDER - DAY

“CRASH” - JAMES spins out...and a tyre bounces along the 
track...JAMES’s car has crashed into a wall...

           JAMES
    I can’t stand it...

The tyre continues bouncing, people diving out of it’s path, 
before the tyre finally smashes into a hot-dog stand... 

CAPTION: “RACE 6. LAUDA WINS AGAIN. HUNT RETIRES.”

EXT. BELGIUM GRAND PRIX - ZOLDER - PITLANE - DAY

JAMES storms back into the pits, screaming at MAYER, CALDWELL 
and the MECHANICS...

           JAMES
    What’s happened? What have you DONE?? 
    The car’s evil! It’s undriveable..! 

CAPTION: “LAUDA 56 POINTS, HUNT 6” 

INT. PADDOCK/PRESS TENT - DAY

Later: the victorious NIKI, wearing the garland, is all 
smiles, giving ‘winner’ interviews, surrounded by MARLENE and 
a delighted LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO.

JAMES is also giving interviews, but in a total fury. 
Vibrating with anger. Still complaining about the 
disqualification. Complaining about a conspiracy. Complaining.

NIKI finishes talking to JOURNALISTS, and walks off, through 
crowds, and bumps into JAMES..

           NIKI
    So...six races in. How’s it going so 
    far?

           JAMES
    Fine! Just got a little problem with a 
    bad loser rat and his team of Italian 
    saboteurs who’ve destroyed my car. 

           NIKI
    What are you talking about? 

           JAMES
    I won that race in Spain. And you know 
    it.

           NIKI
    In an illegal car. 

           JAMES
    The aerofoil was five eighths of an 
    inch too long!! Something that doesn’t 
    have the slightest effect on car 
    speed. You complained. Now we’ve had 
    to totally rebuild the car and it’s 
    become a monster.

           NIKI
    At least it’s a LEGAL monster. 

           JAMES
    A car that was beating you week in 
    week out, so you have to resort to 
    this. Cheating.

           NIKI
    He drives in an illegal car and he 
    calls ME the cheat? Let me tell you: 
    two weeks before that race in Spain, 
    we put 20-inch rims on the rear 
    wheels. We get an extra half second 
    speed on each lap!! But the Old Man 
    tells me we can't use those rims, they 
    make the car too wide. Against the 
    rules. So we go back to 19-inch rims 
    making the car slower again. Rules are 
    rules. For all of us. You’re just a 
    bad loser who can’t accept that. 
       (tapping head, to MARLENE)
    Komm, he’s crazy. Sick in the head. 

NIKI turns to MARLENE, speaks in German...

           NIKI
    Den Trottel lassen wir alleine..
       (Let’s go. Leave this jerk 
       alone.)
    No wonder she left him...

NIKI and MARLENE go. JAMES is left staring. Not understanding.

INT/EXT. ZOLDER PADDOCK/ MCLAREN TRUCK - DAY

JAMES walks into the crowded MCLAREN pits. Sees TEDDY MAYER 
and ALASTAIR CALDWELL...

           JAMES
    Is there something I should know about  
    Suzy? Where is she? Wasn’t she 
    supposed to be here today? 

CALDWELL nervously indicates the Sunday newspapers...

           CALDWELL
    We kept it from you. Didn’t want to 
    tell you before the race...

JAMES looks at the newspapers, then his expression changes.

Lurid headlines about SUZY HUNT in New York with RICHARD 
BURTON. Pictures all over the front pages of RICHARD BURTON, 
ELIZABETH TAYLOR, SUZY and JAMES. JAMES’s face falls..

           JAMES
    Jesus. 


EXT. RUNWAY - DAY

A jumbo jet roars down the runway and takes off...

EXT. MANHATTAN - DAY

The unmistakable skyline. Among the ten thousand craggy 
rooftops and skyscrapers...

A grand, five-star hotel overlooking Central Park in 
Manhattan’s mid-town district...

EXT. HOTEL - MANHATTAN - DAY

A huge collection of paparazzi SNAPPERS and Journalist HACKS 
is camped outside the hotel. 

Immediately a surge of activity, “Here he is”...

A burst of flashlights and a volley of questions from the 
JOURNALISTS as JAMES - gets out of the taxi and runs the 
gauntlet of humiliation...

...into the hotel..

INT. HOTEL SUITE - DAY

A large hotel suite. There are flowers everywhere. Newspapers 
are all over the table. 

JAMES sits opposite SUZY. He sees an expensive gift; recently 
opened. A diamond necklace..

           JAMES
    That from him?

SUZY nods. Even the uninitiated eye can tell: it’s worth a 
fortune. 

           SUZY
    Why have you come here, James? 

           JAMES
    To get you back.

           SUZY
    You don’t want me back...you never 
    wanted to be married in the first 
    place. You did it because you hoped it 
    might change you...settle you down... 
    help with the racing. Not because you 
    loved me. And who knows, if it had 
    been just the drinking, or the dope, 
    or the infidelity, or the moods...it 
    might even have worked...but when it’s 
    all of them?

           JAMES
    I know. I’m terrible.

           SUZY
    No, you’re not terrible. You’re 
    just...who you are...at this point in 
    your life. And God help anyone that 
    wants more.

           JAMES
    Will he be able to give you more? He 
    has quite the bad boy reputation 
    himself. 

           SUZY
    What’s important is how it feels to 
    me. And it feels like he adores me. 

A flicker behind JAMES’s eyes. Failure.

           JAMES
    Right.

           SUZY
    He’s aware of the delicacy of the 
    situation, and how it looks. Having 
    raided your larder. Plundered your 
    safe. Smash and grab, and so forth. So 
    he’s assured me he’ll take care of the 
    financial side. And will be very 
    generous.  

JAMES manages a brave smile.

           JAMES
    Fine. I’ll give him a call.

           SUZY
    No. His lawyers will contact you. 

JAMES notices the vast unmade bed. Where, until recently, two 
people had slept. 

EXT. HOTEL - MANHATTAN - DAY

JAMES emerges from the hotel - into the storm of paparazzi 
again. He manages a brave smile...

           JAMES
    It’s all very amicable. My wife has 
    found herself a new backer...I mean 
    lover...which makes her happy..
       (laughter)
    Mr. Burton has found a way of feeling 
    young again...let’s hope his pockets 
    are deep...they’ll need to be...
       (laughter)
    And I’ve found a way to be single 
    again without it costing me a penny, 
    which has to go down as the biggest 
    win of my career. 

Laughter from the JOURNALISTS who are hungrily writing down 
the copy. But JAMES’s hollow smile fools no one...

INT. JUMBO JET - FIRST CLASS - DAY

JAMES sits alone in the first class section. A loser on the 
track, and a loser in love, too. Being played out in the full 
glare of publicity. On the front pages. Being read by everyone 
on the plane.

A STEWARDESS looks over, catches his eye. Smiles. 

INT. JUMBO JET - WC - DAY

JAMES and the STEWARDESS fucking. Hard. 

Nothing to do with pleasure. An analgesic - a way of blocking 
out the pain. JAMES catches his own reflection in the mirror. 
Teeth clenched. Eyes burning with anger and self-loathing... 

OVER THIS: we fade in the ROAR of car engines...

INT. FRENCH GP 1976 - PAUL RICARD - 4TH JULY 1976

JAMES’s teeth still clenched. Eyes still burning with anger. 
Driving flat out. At the limit. 

Suzy’s words still ringing in his ears.

Make that beyond the limit. At the point of no return. The car 
shaking. Weaving recklessly through other cars...

Where death has become a real option. 

Because he doesn’t care anymore. Because it’s all he deserves 
anyway...

And in that moment, in reaching his lowest point, JAMES has 
unwittingly stumbled on the one thing that gives him an 
advantage over everyone else...

The fact that he doesn’t care. The fact that death has become 
an option. The fact that there is no risk he is not prepared 
to take...

So every corner is tighter, every braking point later, every 
gap is an opening, no matter how tiny...

EXT. FRENCH GRAND PRIX 1976 - PAUL RICARD - DAY

The chequered flag waves as JAMES’s car roars across the 
finish line...

JAMES screams with released rage....

INT. MCLAREN PITS - PAUL RICARD - DAY

Afterwards: TEDDY MAYER, ALASTAIR CALDWELL and JOHN HOGAN 
celebrate in delight...cheering...

EXT. BRITISH GRAND PRIX - 18TH JULY 1976- DAY

NIKI’s car is pursued by JAMES’s. They disappear behind a 
copse of trees. Out of sight. 

When they re-emerge, JAMES is ahead of NIKI, having overtaken 
him - to the delight of the partisan crowd.

The chequered flag waves again as JAMES’s car roars across the 
finish line...

CAPTION: “RACE 8. HUNT WINS. LAUDA 2nd.”

JAMES screams in catharsis and triumph. Teeth clenched. Eyes 
wide and staring with concentration. 

We notice SCREAMING GIRL FANS cheering him now. 


EXT. FIA HEADQUARTERS - DAY

A blazer-wearing FIA OFFICIAL addresses a room full of sports 
and motoring JOURNALISTS, TV CREWS, etc...

           FIA OFFICIAL
    Following an inquiry into the 
    disqualification of driver James Hunt 
    from the Spanish Grand Prix, it has 
    been decided to overturn this 
    disqualification...and to restore his 
    victory, and reinstate his points..

INT. MCLAREN HQ - BRANDS HATCH -DAY

JAMES, TEDDY MAYER, ALASTAIR CALDWELL, and all the MECHANICS 
are watching on TV...

Huge celebrations. Cheering and whooping. SCREAMING GIRLS.

EXT. BRAND’S HATCH - PRESS TENT - DAY

A crowded PRESS room. In opposite corners of the room, JAMES 
and NIKI are giving interviews to different PRESS and TV 
journalists. Stirling Moss is talking to JAMES...

           STIRLING MOSS
    ...James, a few weeks ago, you were 
    out of the running for this season 
    completely, now you’re right back in 
    it. What’s changed...?

Screaming GIRLS in the background, shouting “James, we love 
you.” JAMES stares across the room at NIKI...

           JAMES
    A combination of factors, not all of 
    which I’m prepared to discuss here. 
    Justice being done re: the 
    disqualification in Spain helps, and 
    having my old car back of course... 

In the other corner: NIKI is doing his interviews in German, 
(we see sub-titles)...

           JOURNALIST
    Mathematically in theory it’s now 
    possible for Hunt to catch you. Are 
    you worried?

           NIKI
    Not at all. For him to catch me, he’d 
    have to win all the remaining races, 
    and I’d have to lose them. And pigs 
    would have to fly.

Laughter among the confident GERMANS. 

           NIKI
    Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a 
    private family matter to attend to.

NIKI takes MARLENE’s hand, and leads her away.

EXT. VIENNESE REGISTRY OFFICE - DAY

To establish: the Viennese skyline. 

INT. REGISTRY OFFICE - DAY

NIKI and MARLENE get married. In stark contrast to JAMES’s 
wedding...it’s a small, intimate affair. Modest. Not showy. 
Away from the cameras. Just them. And a witness from the pub.

EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY

A small aeroplane takes off...

INT. AEROPLANE - DAY

NIKI and an INSTRUCTOR are in the plane. In the cockpit. With 
MARLENE, who watches...

NIKI is learning to fly. 

MARLENE watches as NIKI soaks up the instruction, asking 
questions, happy. It’s another side to him, completely. 

EXT. IBIZA - NIGHT

NIKI and MARLENE in a pool. In Ibiza. Playing. Laughing. 
Honeymooning.

Then NIKI’s expression changes. His smile fades.

INT. BEDROOM - HOUSE - IBIZA - NIGHT

MARLENE is fast asleep. She wakes, to discover the bed is 
empty beside her.. 

INT. HOUSE - IBIZA - NIGHT


MARLENE walks through the house, looking for NIKI. Then finds 
him on a balcony...alone..

           MARLENE
    Come to bed.

MARLENE notices his mood. It’s different.

           MARLENE
    What’s the matter?

           NIKI
    It’s the enemy, you know. Happiness. 

NIKI looks up at MARLENE...

           NIKI
    It weakens you. Puts doubt in your 
    mind. Because all of a sudden you have 
    something to lose..

MARLENE stares at him. 

           MARLENE
    When you call happiness an enemy, then 
    it’s too late. 
       (a beat)
    Then you have lost already.

MARLENE turns, and goes..

NIKI is left alone. We can tell from his expression, he is 
struggling with something for the first time. Fear.

EXT. NURBURGRING - DAY

The notoriously difficult and treacherous German race track. 

Testing is underway. A CAR (from one of the other teams) 
skids, and crashes violently. 

EXT. NURBURGRING - CRASH SITE - DAY

AMBULANCES arrive. The Driver is badly hurt. Screaming in 
pain. His leg is crushed. Bone is sticking out. A brutal 
compound fracture. He is taken away.

INT/EXT. NURBURGRING PITLANE - DAY

In the pits, everyone is shaken. JAMES, REGAZZONI, and other 
DRIVERS nervously talk among themselves as the Ambulance races 
past.  

NIKI’s face: visibly pale. More frightened than ever.

EXT. NURBURGRING - DAY

Race-day. Huge crowds arrive at the Nurburgring. And rain. 
Heavy rain falling.

Television commentary informs us about the Nurburgring’s 
terrible reputation as a ‘graveyard’ track. 

EXT. NURBURGRING - DAY

JAMES arrives at the race track, to find ALASTAIR CALDWELL 
waiting for him, a concerned look on his face...

           CALDWELL
    We’ve just been told, a driver’s 
    meeting has been called.

           JAMES
    Who by?


           CALDWELL
    Niki.

JAMES’s face. Instantly suspicious.

INT. MEETING ROOM - NURBURGRING RACE TRACK - DAY

About sixty people, (26 DRIVERS and all the different team 
REPRESENTATIVES), are assembled in the room, where a blazered 
FIA OFFICIAL and a member of the DRIVERS SAFETY COMMITTEE are 
sitting behind a table...

A buzz of anticipation and curiosity. What’s going on? What is 
all this about? NIKI gets to his feet, raises his hands 
calling for silence...

           NIKI
    Thank you. I called this meeting 
    because as all drivers know the 
    Nurburgring is a race track from the 
    Stone Ages. The most stupid, barbaric, 
    outdated, dangerous, track in the 
    world. You’ve all seen the rain which 
    has been falling this morning. Those 
    of you with experience know the Ring 
    needs perfect conditions to be even 
    remotely acceptable in terms of risk. 
    As you can see today is anything BUT 
    perfect, so I called this meeting to 
    take a vote to cancel the race.

A ripple of astonished reactions among the drivers..

           NIKI
    There would be no change to the 
    situation as far as points is 
    concerned. The race would simply be 
    cancelled.

TEDDY MAYER looks over at FERRARI representatives....

           MAYER
    This is bullshit...

Another DRIVER (GUY EDWARDS) gets to his feet...

           EDWARDS
    If the race is cancelled, none of us 
    get our race fees...

           NIKI
    It’s true. You leave without your fee, 
    but you might leave with your LIFE.

Another voice pierces the controversy...

           VOICE
    It also means you would effectively 
    win the championship.

It’s JAMES HUNT, who is standing up...

           JAMES
    So I can see why this suits you just 
    fine. 

           NIKI
    Why? There would be no points for me 
    either...

           JAMES
    But there would be one race less where 
    I, or anyone else, could catch you. 

Uproar in the room...

           BRETT LUNGER
    James is right! This is just tactics! 

           ARTURO MERZARIO
    Ferrari’s dirty tricks! We’ve seen it 
    before!

           HARALD ERTL
    Maybe it’s just that he’s frightened? 

Laughter among the DRIVERS...

           NIKI
    Which asshole said this? 

Silence. No hand goes up. No one has the courage to own up.

           NIKI
    Yes, I am frightened. Always a little 
    bit when I race. I accept every time I 
    get in my car there is 20% chance that 
    I could die. But not one per cent 
    more. And today, with the rain the 
    risk IS more. How dare you accuse me 
    of lack of courage? Let me remind you. 
    I have the track record here. I am the 
    only person in history to do the Ring 
    in under 7 minutes. So actually it’s 
    to my ADVANTAGE to race here today. 
    Because I’m quicker than all of you.

A stunned silence. One voice pierces the room...

           JAMES
    Fine. Then let’s race!

It’s JAMES who stares at NIKI: a ripple of excitement and 
enthusiasm among the other drivers...

           JAMES
    There’s a hundred thousand fans out 
    there who would never forgive us if we 
    didn’t. 

           MERZARIO
    And some of us need our race fees!!

           FIA OFFICIAL
    All those in favour of cancelling the 
    race?

NIKI puts his hand up. One or two other racers, too...

           FIA OFFICIAL
    All those in favour of racing?

JAMES puts his hand up. Clearly the more popular, charismatic 
figure among the DRIVERS, everyone else follows.

           FIA OFFICIAL
    Gentlemen, start your engines!!

A clear victory for JAMES. He has swung the room.

Everyone leaves the room. JAMES and TEDDY MAYER give one 
another a discreet hi-five...

But we rack focus through the crowd to see NIKI staring at 
JAMES accusingly...holding his gaze.

EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY

“RRRROAAAR”, an explosion of noise, as we widen and find 
ourselves on the starting grid of the German Grand Prix. 

An OFFICIAL walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, “One 
Minute”...

Deafening, angry thunder, as cars rev their engines. 

AN EYE FLICKERS - WIDE OPEN - STARING INTENTLY

A pupil dilates and contracts in the light. The eye stares. 
Blinks. Thinks. Making evaluations..

EXT. CLOUDY SKY - GERMANY - DAY

This time the eye belongs to JAMES. He stares up at the 
clouds. 

His eyelids flicker. Thinking. Agonizing. Wrestling with an 
all important decision...

Is it going to carry on raining? Or become dry? 

ALASTAIR CALDWELL comes up to JAMES, and shouts above the 
noise - no time to plug his headset in...

           CALDWELL
    Jochen’s going on slicks. You want to 
    change?

JAMES looks in his wing-mirror back to his colleague, JOCHEN 
MASS’s car, number 12, several rows behind him. 

White helmet. A team of Mclaren MECHANICS hastily changing the 
tyres to bald, dry tyres - (’slicks’). Then JAMES looks over 
at the car beside him...

           JAMES
    Has Niki changed?

           CALDWELL
    No. He’s going on wets.

NIKI’s car: surrounded by Italian Ferrari MECHANICS.

           JAMES
    Then we go on wets, too.

JAMES pulls down his visor...as he and NIKI’s eyes meet for a 
split-second, then...

The STARTER waves the flag. They’re off! 

JAMES’s foot hits the floor - his engine screams at almost 
9,000 rpms, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd. The 
car is catapaulted forward, the wheel-spin leaving livid black 
scars on the asphalt..

JAMES and NIKI both make good starts, and are neck and neck, 
but within seconds there’s a McLaren right behind them, 
gaining fast. 

JAMES realizes it’s his team-mate, JOCHEN MASS in a white 
helmet. Number 12. On his slick tyres. 

MASS was right to gamble on the track drying out. JAMES curses 
under his breath...

           JAMES
    Shit...!

JAMES screwed up. Made the wrong decision. He urgently needs 
to change tyres. With barely one lap completed...

He swerves angrily into the pits..

INT. PITS - DAY

Commentary from all the world’s TV stations explaining the 
crazy, panicked situation as JAMES comes into the pits to 
change to dry tyres.

The McLaren team frantically changes the tyres. Four men with 
air guns, two men with rapid-duty jacks. 

ALASTAIR CALDWELL appears, talks to JAMES..

           CALDWELL
    See? I told you to go on slicks!! You 
    didn’t take my advice...

           JAMES
    Shut up! Where’s Niki?

           CALDWELL
    Behind you! He made the same mistake! 

JAMES looks in his mirror to see NIKI’s red helmet behind him 
in the pits, then...

“Thump”, new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac. JAMES gets the 
signal, ‘Clear!’ 

           CALDWELL
    Go! Go!! Go!!

JAMES’s foot hits the floor. He roars out, with new tyres, 
leaving NIKI behind him in the pits...

EXT. NUBURGRING - DAY

Archive commentary: from the world’s TV stations informs us 
that JAMES roars up into 3rd position..

INT. JAMES’S CAR - DAY

JAMES gives it everything he’s got. Tearing through the gears, 
breaking as late as he can, engine screaming. 

The world flies past in a blur. The steering wheel shakes. The 
car cannot be driven any harder. No thought for safety. No 
thought of failure..

Failure is unimaginable. Unconscionable.

He turns into the final straight, then stops when he sees 
something ahead. 

Flags. Red flags. RACE MARSHALLS. Something has clearly 
happened. An accident..

The race is being stopped. JAMES brakes, slowing down. He 
pulls level with a uniformed MARSHALL..

           JAMES
    What’s up?

           MARSHALL
    Accident. Bad one.

           JAMES
    Who?

           MARSHALL
    We don’t know yet.


INT. NIKI’S CAR - SAME TIME

NIKI’s POV: a continuation of the opening scene. Burning smoke 
fills NIKI’s helmet, burning his lungs. He cries out in agony.

           NIKI
    AAAAARRRRGHGHGGHGH!!!!

We can just make out the barely recognizable figures of the 
other DRIVERS rushing towards him, as their hands get burnt in 
the flames as they try unsuccessfully to undo his seatbelt...

We notice it is the same DRIVERS that were critical of NIKI in 
the driver’s meeting. HARALD ERTL, BRETT LUNGER, ARTURO 
MERZARIO, GUY EDWARDS...

Fire extinguishers blast at the car. Covering NIKI’s helmet. 
Filling his lungs with chemicals, along with the smoke and 
fumes, blurring his vision, as he screams horribly..

The sound of panicked TV COMMENTARY in different languages. 
Screaming voices. Panicked reactions. 

Then sound fades. As NIKI blacks out - losing consciousness.

FADE TO BLACK:

OVER THIS: the hypnotic sound of helicopter blades...

           NIKI    August 1st, 1976, I discovered comas 
    exist for a reason. 

EXT. MANNHEIM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - DAY

NIKI’s POV: the door to a helicopter opens, as it arrives at 
Mannheim University Hospital...

The sound of shouting voices. Hospital STAFF pull reach 
towards NIKI, pull his stretcher out.

NIKI’s internal voice groans: cries out at the pain.

           NIKI
    Some things are better not remembered.

INT. MANNHEIM UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - DAY


“Crash”, doors burst open and NIKI is rushed into emergency. 
Neon ceiling lights pass overhead...

The sound of difficult breathing.

His stretcher is surrounded by DOCTORS, talking urgently, 
making quick assessments.. 

NIKI’s POV: fading in and out of consciousness. 

Bursts of concerned, urgent, overlapping dialogue among the 
German DOCTORS which NIKI can barely make out..

INT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - MANNHEIM HOSPITAL - DAY


Two narrow, barely open slits of light. NIKI’s swollen eye-
lids. NIKI’s POV: barely making out MARLENE standing beside 
the senior burns specialist DOCTOR. NIKI hears voices...

           DOCTOR
    It’s not the burns to his face that 
    are the danger. It’s the burns to his 
    lungs. His blood oxygen level is 
    currently...

           NURSE
    6.8. 

           DOCTOR
    Which is not enough to maintain 
    life...

NIKI slips out of consciousness again. MARLENE is distraught, 
in tears.

INT. JAMES’S APARTMENT - LONDON - NIGHT

JAMES sits watching the news on TV in his apartment, while 
feeding his budgerigars, (the collection has grown).. 

He feels terrible. He goes to his desk, pulls out paper and 
pen...

JAMES tries to find the right words, tries to write, tries to 
put his feelings on paper, but words in general, and letters 
in particular have never been his thing...

JAMES scrunches up the pieces of paper, throws it away. The 
budgerigars, sensing his distress, flutter and peep..

INT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - DAY


NIKI’s P.O.V: feels someone touching his forehead and his 
hands with oil...and the sound of a WOMAN weeping...

           PRIEST
    ...durch diese heilige Salbung helfe 
    dir der Herr in seinem reichen 
    Erbarmen, er stehe dir bei mit der 
    Kraft des Heiligen Geistes...

NIKI’s eyes barely crack open, barely manage to focus to see 
an ELDERLY PRIEST is giving him the last rites in German.. 

The sound of MARLENE crying somewhere in the room.

           PRIEST
    Der Herr der dich von Sunden befreit, 
    rette dich in seiner Gnade richte er 
    dich auf... 

NIKI strains to move. A sense of excruciating pain. 

He fights to open his eyes, give an indication...ANY 
indication of the fact that he is hearing this, and is alive 
and able to fight for life...

But to no avail. The PRIEST continues giving last rites. 
MARLENE continues to cry. The PRIEST touches NIKI’s 
shoulder...

           NIKI
    I’m here! Can’t you tell? I’m here! 

NIKI screams inside. Wanting to be heard. Wanting to give them 
a sign. He’s OK. He’s still there. But it’s no use. 

NIKI blacks out again. The pain is too great.

FADE TO BLACK:

INT. CORRIDOR - HOSPITAL - DAY

Sunrise: MARLENE has been sitting in the hospital all night 
supported by members of FAMILY and several FRIENDS. 

Niki’s MOTHER and FATHER. CLAY REGAZZONI.

Presently: the door to the intensive care unit opens and a 
DOCTOR comes out, beckoning her...

           DOCTOR
    Frau Lauda? Bitte kommen Sie! He’s 
    awake! And just spoke!

MARLENE scrambles to her feet... 

           MARLENE
    What did he say?

           DOCTOR
    “Tell the Priest to fuck off! I’m 
    still alive!!”

MARLENE covers her mouth, laughs nervously, already in tears. 
She and the DOCTOR rush into the intensive care unit.

EXT. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT - DAY

Shooting through the window we see MARLENE approach NIKI’s 
bed. She sees NIKI..

And gasps. Trying to control her expression. Not give away to 
him how horrified she is. 

NIKI’s face: is grotesque. His head has swollen to double it’s 
size. The skin has burned off on his head, his eyes. 

MARLENE bravely composes herself. Then, without displaying the 
shock she feels - she goes over and kisses him.  

INT. NIKI’S HOSPITAL ROOM/TELEVISION COVERAGE FULL FRAME -DAY

The starter’s flag drops. On television we see the Austrian 
Grand Prix start. 

NIKI watches the race on television, while beginning his rehab 
in bed, in pain as bandages are changed..

ON TV: JAMES narrowly misses out on a podium, but still gains 
on NIKI in his points total...

CAPTION: “RACE 11. HUNT FINISHES 4th”

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY - (A WEEK LATER)

NIKI continues his rehab in the hospital, now out of bed...

ON TV: the starter’s flag drops. Another Grand Prix starts. 
This time at Zandvoort, in the Netherlands..

NIKI watches the race on television as DOCTORS put a vacuuum 
pump into his lungs. It’s AGONY. JAMES leads, driving the 
perfect race...  

           YOUNG GERMAN DOCTOR
    We need to vacuum the lungs. Without 
    this, they can’t heal. But it will 
    hurt.

An unimaginably painful pump is forced down his burned lungs, 
to try to hoover out the impurities..

COMMENTATORS ON TV: talk about how HUNT is catching up with 
LAUDA on points. It spurs NIKI on, through gritted teeth.

           NIKI
    Aaarrrggghhhh...

The chequered flag. JAMES crosses the line in first position.

CAPTION: “RACE 12. HUNT WINS.”

The DOCTORS tell NIKI he’s had enough vacuum treatment. He’s 
had more than enough pain. But NIKI waves them aside... 

           NIKI
    Again!!

The DOCTOR nods. The vacuum is turned on again.

NIKI screams in agony. Eyes bulging. MARLENE and NIKI’s family 
cannot bear to watch...

He watches as ON TV: JAMES is on the victory podium spraying 
champagne.

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

NIKI continues screaming in pain, watching the Canadian GP on 
TV as..

CAPTION: “RACE 13 CANADIAN GRAND PRIX. HUNT WINS AGAIN”

For the first time, JAMES has taken the lead in points. NIKI 
stares at the TV: his expression changes. 

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

NIKI screams again. MARLENE, NIKI’s family and the DOCTORS are 
deeply distressed, cannot bring themselves to watch, as...

           NIKI
    Aaaaarrrrggghghhhhhh!!

We WIDEN to reveal what NIKI is doing. What has caused these 
unbearable, bloodcurdling screams of agony..

           NIKI
    I know what you’re all thinking...

Now we see. With great difficulty NIKI has put his racing 
helmet on for the first time. Pressing into his open burn 
wounds...

           NIKI
    But if you love me - all of you - you 
    won’t say a word.

He is almost unconscious with pain. His legs are weak. But he 
has done it...

EXT. ITALIAN GRAND PRIX - MONZA - 12TH SEPT 1976 -DAY

The Italian Grand Prix. TELEVISION COMMENTARY sets the scene. 

JAMES and the MCLAREN TEAM arrive in the pits to see a vast 
commotion going on elsewhere...

           JAMES
    What’s going on?

           CALDWELL
    Jesus. It’s Niki. 

           JAMES
    What about him? 

           CALDWELL
    He’s here! He’s racing!

           JAMES
    What?? They said he was half-dead.

JAMES stares. Shaken. 

EXT. MONZA PITLANE/ FERRARI PITS - DAY

JAMES pushes through the pitlanes, until he reaches the 
crowded FERRARI pits. He sees a racer in the background. The 
name LAUDA on his overalls...

           JAMES
    Niki?

NIKI turns round. JAMES sets eyes on him for the first time. 

JAMES reels, visibly horrified by his appearance. His bandages 
are blood stained. He has no hair. Looks grotesque..

NIKI sees the horror in JAMES’s face. Sees the shock. The 
horror. And recognizes in that moment, this is how it’s going 
to be - this is how people will respond to him - forever.

           NIKI
    Wow. It’s that bad, huh?

JAMES opens his mouth. Tries to say something.

           NIKI
    In the hospital I told them to tell me 
    straight, no bullshit - how bad it 
    would be. My appearance. They said 
    with time it’d be fine. But it won’t. 
    I can tell, seeing your reaction. I am 
    going to spend the rest of my life 
    with a face that frightens people. 

NIKI stares at JAMES, at his rival’s beauty, his blonde, 
tanned perfection. His matinee idol, movie star looks...

           NIKI
    That’s a tough one to get used to.

           JAMES
    I wrote you a letter at the time. To 
    apologize. 
       (a beat)

           JAMES 
    The driver’s meeting in Germany? 
    Before the race? I swayed the room. 

           NIKI
    Yes. You did.  

           JAMES
    That race should never have gone 
    ahead. 

           NIKI
    No.

           JAMES
    So in some ways...I feel responsible 
    for what happened. I’m sorry. 

           NIKI
    Trust me, watching you win those 
    points and all those races while I was 
    in hospital fighting for my life...you 
    were equally responsible for getting 
    me better.

Ouch. That could have been meant generously. But in this case 
it wasn’t. It was a cold slap in the face. 

NIKI turns and goes. 

INT. MONZA GRAND PRIX - PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY

A packed press conference. The world’s media. NIKI’s accident 
and recovery (as a story) has reached way beyond F1 race fans. 
This is front page news around the globe..

NIKI walks out onto the podium - all eyes staring at him - the 
sense of a ghoulish, voyeuristic freak show....

NIKI sits on the podium, in front of microphones, flanked on 
both sides by FERRARI drivers and top brass. But no one wants 
to talk to them. Everyone’s here to talk to NIKI..

           JAPANESE JOURNALIST
    How are you feeling, Niki?

           NIKI
    Fine.

           AMERICAN JOURNALIST
    Can you confirm for us exactly which 
    procedures you have had? And the 
    expectations for your recovery?

           NIKI
    Sure. I had a skin graft operation 
    where they put half my right thigh in 
    my face. It doesn’t look too good but 
    one unexpected advantage is it’s 
    impossible to perspire through a skin 
    graft, so sweat will never run in my 
    eyes again - which is good for a 
    driver. 

Laughter. At the back of the hall, JAMES HUNT creeps in, 
(unseen by anyone, disguised in a hat), to listen.

           BRAZILIAN JOURNALIST
    When they heard about your condition, 
    Ferrari immediately hired another 
    driver, Carlos Reutemann. 

           NIKI
    Ja. Before even my first operation. 

           JAPANESE JOURNALIST
    Is he your replacement now? 

           NIKI
    No. Just another team-mate. Keen to 
    make an impression. So let’s see where 
    Mr. Reutemann finishes today. 

           JAPANESE JOURNALIST
    James Hunt and McLaren have caught up 
    a lot while you were away.

           NIKI
    Yes. 
       (a beat)
    Is there a question now? Or are you 
    just trying to piss me off?

           JAPANESE JOURNALIST
    You think you can still win?

           NIKI
    Of course. I have the better car. I’m 
    the better driver. But he’s a clever 
    guy and has used the time well while I 
    was lying half-dead in hospital to win 
    some points..

Laughter.

Laughter.

Laughter.

           BRITISH JOURNALIST
    What did your wife say when she saw 
    your face?

           NIKI
    She said, “Sweetie, you don’t need a 
    face to drive. Only a right foot.”

Laughter. 

           BRITISH JOURNALIST
    I’m being serious. Do you really think 
    your marriage can survive? With the 
    way you look now?

Silence. NIKI squints into the lights..

           NIKI
    And I’m being serious, too. Which 
    asshole said this? Jesus..

No one moves. NIKI, disgusted, rips off his microphone..

           NIKI
    Fuck you. Press conference over.

NIKI walks out. The Press Conference breaks up...

JAMES sees the REPORTER who asked the question, laughing with 
his friends. JAMES watches as the REPORTER leaves...

INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRESS CONFERENCE - SAME TIME

JAMES goes after the REPORTER, and calls him..

           JAMES
    Hey..! 

The REPORTER turns, recognizes JAMES..

           JAMES
    I’ve got something for you on that 
    last question...

The BRITISH JOURNALIST smiles, “Great, thanks James!” Pulls 
out a tape recorder. JAMES takes him to one side, then...

“WHACK, WHACK, WHACK” - JAMES punches his lights out, then 
takes the tape recorder, stuffs it into the JOURNALISTS mouth.

           JAMES
    Now go home to your wife and ask her 
    how YOU look!!

“CRASH” a final, sickening blow splits the REPORTER’s nose.. 

           JAMES
    Prick!


EXT. STARTING GRID - MONZA - DAY

JAMES walks out to his car. TV CREWS. Banks of PHOTOGRAPHERS. 
Commentators talk in different languages.

Everyone talking about NIKI’s comeback.

NIKI is in his car. The MECHANICS are talking to him in 
Italian...

But NIKI hears nothing. He looks at the steering wheel, the 
shell of the car, the gear stick. And then we see..

His hands are shaking violently. He’s utterly terrified. 

The light turns green. They’re off!

Other cars (including JAMES’s), roar forward. But NIKI is 
frozen. 

EXT. TRACK - DAY

NIKI’s mind is a mess - terrified - he starts slowly...finding 
his courage..

COMMENTATORS point out it’s madness. It was clearly too soon. 
Ferrari were right to hire a replacement. NIKI is a wreck..

NIKI suffers terrible flashbacks from his accident...

NIKI shakes himself out...gradually building up speed - 
ignoring the cars overtaking him all around him...

NIKI begins to accelerate. Gently at first. Then a bit more. 
Trusting himself. Gaining confidence..

Blocking out further flashbacks...

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Watching NIKI from the hospital where he had his treatment is 
the DOCTOR who treated him...
EXT. TRACK - DAY

COMMENTATORS look up. Notice NIKI’s slow increase in speed. 
What’s this? Maybe there’s life in him yet...

NIKI changes gears smoothly. He begins to overtake. The old 
feelings come back..

EXT. PADDOCK/PITS - SAME TIME

MARLENE watches from the pits. Can hardly bring herself to 
look...

EXT. TRACK - DAY

COMMENTATORS begin to get excited. LAUDA has started to 
overtake the back-markers...

An incredible sequence. As NIKI gains more confidence, more 
speed, and begins to work his way through the field..

COMMENTATORS now buzzing with excitement. This is incredible, 
as NIKI overtakes first CARLOS REUTEMANN, the driver hired to 
replace him, then others, working his way through the field...

INT. JAMES’S CAR - SAME TIME

JAMES sees NIKI coming up behind him. Cannot believe his eyes. 
JAMES move to block NIKI’s path...

NIKI attacks fearlessly. Despite terrible pain. NIKI moves to 
overtake JAMES. 

Utterly intimidated by NIKI’s bravery, JAMES panics, and loses 
control of the car. He spins out..

COMMENTATORS cannot believe their eyes. HUNT’s blown it! 
LAUDA’s overtaken him!

It’s a miracle. It defies belief. As NIKI crosses the line....

CAPTION: “RACE 15. NIKI 4th. JAMES RETIRED.”

EXT. MONZA - DAY

The Italian crowds are ecstatic. Delirious. NIKI is a national 
hero. Lazarus back from the dead. Superhuman. 

TV commentary in different languages elaborates on what an 
extraordinary, superhuman achievement they have just seen...

CAPTION: “LAUDA 68 POINTS. HUNT 65 POINTS.” 

           STIRLING MOSS
    What a race! What a man! What a 
    season! Now it all boils down to the 
    final race in Japan!

Hunt walks past, staring at a triumphant Niki.

INT. HOSPITAL - SAME TIME

The DOCTOR in the hospital shakes his head, cannot believe 
what he has just witnessed...

EXT. PITS - SAME TIME

The Ferrari Mechanics that had initially so disliked NIKI, are 
overwhelmed by what he has achieved...

EXT. TRACK - DAY

A reluctant, modest NIKI carried on shoulders, surrounded by 
LUCA DI MONTEZEMOLO, MARLENE and the PRESS...

EXT. FUJI SPEEDWAY - JAPAN - DAY

CUT TO:

Mount Fuji towers imperiously, dramatically above the Japanese 
race track, dominating the skyline on a clear day..

Television cameras and press photographers assemble at the 
race track for the biggest sporting event of the year...

INT. JAMES’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

JAMES sits alone in his hotel suite. Speaking to an old, 
trusted friend at the other end...

           JAMES (ON PHONE)
    The man was in a coma. His doctors 
    pronounced him dead!! Then he comes 
    back and does THAT??? 

INT. BUBBLES HORSELY HOME - MORNING

BUBBLES HORSLEY back at home in England. At a breakfast 
table..

           BUBBLES (ON PHONE)
    What did you expect? That Niki would 
    give you the championship lying down? 
    Of course not. He’s a fighter. He’s 
    going to come at you with everything 
    he’s got. But you can do this. As a 
    driver, you’re his equal - better, 
    maybe. And God knows you’re quick and 
    brave enough. You just.. 

           JAMES (ON PHONE)
    What?

           BUBBLES (ON PHONE)
    Need to find the respect for yourself 
    to close out when it really matters. 
    You don’t much like yourself, James - 
    that’s the problem, therefore don’t 
    believe you deserve it.

INT. JAMES’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

A knock at JAMES’s hotel room door..

           JAMES
    I’ve got to go.

JAMES hangs up, and goes to the door. He snaps it open to 
reveal..

Two gorgeous-looking BOAC Stewardesses standing outside. Smart 
blue blazers, short skirts, white gloves, blue caps..

           STEWARDESS
    Hi. We’ve come for the party?

           JAMES
    What party?

           STEWARDESS
    The party we were told was going on in 
    room 2109.

Sure enough: on JAMES’s door, the number 2109.

           JAMES
    Who sent you here? 

           STEWARDESS
    A man. On the phone. He didn’t give 
    his name. 

           JAMES
    This man. Did he speak with an accent?

           STEWARDESS
    Yes. German accent.

JAMES can’t believe it. NIKI.

           JAMES
    I’m afraid it was a joke..

           STEWARDESS
       (liking the look of JAMES)
    Awwww. Pity.

           JAMES
    Sorry, ladies. Any other time. Not 
    tonight.

JAMES closes the door. Goes back into his hotel room. Then, 
after a moment...

He snaps open the door. The STEWARDESSES are about to 
disappear into the elevator...

           JAMES
    Wait..! 

EXT. TOKYO SKYLINE - DAWN

The following morning, day barely breaks. The skies are 
ominously dark over Tokyo. Thick, black clouds.

It’s raining heavily... 

INT. NIKI’S BEDROOM - HOTEL - DAY

NIKI wakes up and looks out of the window. Sees the heavy rain 
which is falling outside...

His expression changes. 

177

INT. JAMES’S BEDROOM - HOTEL - DAY

JAMES wakes up. Flinches. JAMES looks around, bleary-eyed. 
Hungover.

He’s in a room that looks like a bomb has hit it. 

The two STEWARDESSES are still asleep in the bed beside him. 
Uniforms discarded on the floor.

Memories are now flooding back. Jesus, what was he THINKING? 
JAMES leaps out of bed. 


INT. NIKI’S ROOM - HOTEL - DAY

NIKI is being massaged by WILLI DUNGL in his hotel room in 
preparation for the race. 

NIKI continues to stare out of the window. They speak in 
German. We see sub-titles..

           NIKI
    Can’t see the mountain.

           DUNGL
    So?

           NIKI
    The locals here believe if you can see 
    the mountain in the morning, it brings 
    good luck.

NIKI’s POV: the view. Nothing but mist, dark skies and rain.

EXT. JAPANESE GRAND PRIX - FUJI SPEEDWAY - 24TH OCT 1976 -DAY

Inside the race track: puddles everywhere. The rain continues 
to fall. The circuit is covered in water...

DRIVERS and the TEAMS arrive at the race track. JAMES and 
TEDDY MAYER and ALASTAIR CALDWELL among them...

SPECTATORS are huddled under umbrellas. TV CREWS struggle to 
keep expensive equipment dry...

An American VOICE comes over the tannoy...

           TANNOY
    All drivers to the control tower, 
    please. Immediately. 

JAMES looks at CALDWELL...

INT. CONTROL TOWER - MEETING ROOM - DAY

A driver’s meeting has been called. All the DRIVERS are in a 
small room, arguing and remonstrating with FIA OFFICIALS and 
blazer-wearing POWERS THAT BE...

A Japanese official, (AKIYAMA), is trying to keep the peace... 

           AKIYAMA
    One at a time! Gentlemen, please! 

Local JAPANESE DRIVERS are complaining in Japanese, (we see 
sub-titles)... 

           TAKAHARA
    You can’t send us out in that! It’s a 
    death sentence! 

           HASEMI
    You have to postpone the race! 

INT. CONTROL TOWER - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE - SAME TIME

JAMES, MAYER and CALDWELL arrive in a corridor outside the 
meeting room...

           MAYER
    Niki’s talking to them about 
    cancelling the race.

JAMES’s POV: he can see NIKI, his wounds horribly visible, 
remonstrating with the JAPANESE OFFICIAL about the dangerous 
track conditions...

JAMES turns to TEDDY and ALASTAIR...

           JAMES
    I don’t want any part of this. I’m not 
    going to be responsible for turning 
    the room again.

           CALDWELL
    But you have no option. You HAVE to 
    race, James. It’s your only shot. If 
    you don’t, Niki wins.. 

           JAMES
    I’m not voting against Niki 
    again....or forcing fellow drivers to 
    risk their lives. Sorry. World 
    Championship or not...

JAMES raises his hands and walks off. CALDWELL shouts after 
him, “James, wait..!” Then MAYER reassures CALDWELL...

           MAYER
    Don’t worry, this race is going ahead. 
    The TV rights have been sold all 
    around the world. 

MAYER can see that a vote is taking place in the room. Many of 
the drivers have their hands in the air, voting...

The JAPANESE OFFICIAL is struggling to keep order in the room.

           MAYER
    The drivers can vote all they like. 

A round of applause in the room, as the DRIVERS vote to cancel 
the race. But unseen by the DRIVERS..

The FIA OFFICIALS, TV NETWORK EXECUTIVES, and the blazered 
POWERS THAT BE are in dark, conspiratorial discussion.. 

...making the decision that the race goes ahead.

ARCHIVE TELEVISION FOOTAGE

NEWSCASTERS from all over the world, in several different 
languages, announce that a decision has been made..

The JAPANESE Grand Prix is definitely going ahead. The drivers 
have been called to the starting grid...

INT. PITS - VARIOUS - DAY

In the pits alongside JAMES...

A series of shots of the other DRIVERS...being sent out like 
lambs to the slaughter...

Visibly terrified, mouthing prayers, smoking last cigarettes, 
meditating, crossing themselves, hands shaking.. 

Among them the JAPANESE DRIVERS. All laughter gone now. 
Realizing what they’ve got into. Risking their lives.

Finally we come to rest on NIKI. Strangely calm.

NIKI puts on his balaclava over his still-raw wounds, wincing 
with pain as he puts on his helmet..

EXT. JAPANESE GP - STARTING GRID - DAY

JAMES is piggy-backed to his car by MECHANICS so his feet 
don’t get soaked in the water pooling deep on the track.

EXT. JAPANESE GP - STARTING GRID - DAY

JAMES lowers himself into a car with puddles on the seat. He 
straps himself in.  

ALISTAIR CALDWELL approaches with a power-drill. Leans towards 
JAMES, with the screaming drill...

           CALDWELL
    Keep still...

           JAMES
    What are you doing???

‘ZZZZ”, “ZZZZ”, “ZZZZ”, CALDWELL drill holes in JAMES’s visor.

           CALDWELL
    To let the condensation out.

           JAMES
    But it will also let the water in.

           CALDWELL
    Not if you’re leading. 

CALDWELL stares at JAMES...

           CALDWELL
    Trust me. This race is all about the 
    start. Whoever’s in front will see 
    everything. Whoever’s second... 

CALDWELL gestures, “Nothing”..

           CALDWELL
    Good luck.

They shake hands. JAMES starts the engine with a roar. 

EXT. STARTING GRID - DAY

NIKI’s engine replies with a loud roar. He looks over at 
JAMES. JAMES turns to face NIKI..

ALL SOUND GOES SILENT...

...as JAMES and NIKI stare at one another. All around them, 
the world slows down. Comes to a standstill. 

THEIR EYES MEET...

A connection between them. Unspoken realization of where they 
have both got to. What this moment means. For them both.. 

It’s what they have been waiting for. Working towards. All 
this time.

NIKI raises his hand. In a gesture only JAMES sees. JAMES 
raises his in return. A private salute. 

Chivalric. From a bygone era. And in that moment, enemies 
become brothers. Two men. Risking their lives. 

THE TEN SECOND FLAG IS RAISED..

The moment’s truce is broken. They return to the task at hand. 

THE FLAG DROPS. THEY’RE OFF.

EXT. RACE - JAPANESE GRAND PRIX - DAY

HUNT’s foot hits the floor. NIKI’s foot hits the floor...

JAMES gets the better start. His car aquaplanes like crazy, 
skating over the water, totally out of control...

EXT. FUJI PIT WALL - DAY

CALDWELL and MAYER watch from the pit wall...

           CALDWELL
    Hold onto it, James..!

EXT. RACE - JAPANESE GRAND PRIX - DAY

Miraculously JAMES steadies the car...

The spray from his wheels creates a curtain of mist. The other 
cars are wrapped inside it...

But JAMES has a clear view ahead. He slams his foot down..

           COMMENTATOR
    It’s the perfect start for Hunt! 

INT. NIKI’S CAR - SAME TIME

NIKI can see nothing. Surrounded by spray, water, noise. 

Other cars are spinning all around him. It’s chaos. NIKI 
bravely accelerates into blindness...

           COMMENTATOR (V/O)
    But Lauda’s car is right on his tail! 
    Barely visible in the spray..! 

EXT. RACE - JAPANESE GRAND PRIX - DAY 

JAMES goes to a corner, then his car twitches, aquaplanes 
again...badly...almost losing it completely...

           COMMENTATOR (V/O)
    Hunt turns too tightly! He almost lost 
    his car right there...!

INT. EASTON NESTON - DAY

BUBBLES HORSLEY, ALEXANDER HESKETH and a number of the 
characters from the Hesketh Racing days are all watching...

           HESKETH
    Concentrate, Superstar!

INT. JAMES’S CAR - DAY

JAMES struggles to hold onto his car. He steadies it, 
maintaining the lead. 

INT. NIKI’S CAR - SAME TIME

JAMES’s spray makes it impossible for NIKI to see. NIKI can’t 
blink his eyes...it’s agony.

Half-blind, NIKI tries to overtake. Gives it everything he’s 
got, breaking as late as he can, tearing through the gears... 

For NIKI the world flies past in a near-blind blur. The 
steering wheel shakes. The car cannot be driven any harder.

But the visibility is terrible. The spray tears into his 
scarred eyes. He is unable to see anything but...

MARLENE’s beautiful face: staring at him. Smiling tenderly. 
Kissing him tenderly.

EXT. RACE TRACK - JAPAN - SAME TIME

JAMES continues to race flat out. Engine screaming. Foot to 
the floor. His car aquaplanes again...almost skidding out... 

INT. HOTEL - MANHATTAN - SAME TIME

SUZY HUNT is watching on television as RICHARD BURTON talks in 
the background on the telephone...

           SUZY
       (urging him on)
    Come on, James...

EXT. PITS - RACE TRACK - JAPAN - DAY

A sign is held up as JAMES races. Lap 39.

But there are problems with the car. One of the tyres... 

           CALDWELL
    God! His front tyre! Look! It’s 
    completely frayed!

CALDWELL and TEDDY MAYER watch in horror from the pits and on 
TV. They can see the shaking car..

           COMMENTATOR
    Hunt’s car has problems...it’s 
    shaking...the Englishman is definitely 
    getting slower...

EXT. PITS - RACE TRACK - JAPAN - DAY

ALASTAIR CALDWELL holds up a sign....

CHANGE TYRE

           COMMENTATOR
    ...with just a few laps to go, McLaren 
    are calling for Hunt to come into the 
    pits to change tyres...

JAMES’s car roars past the pits, refusing to stop... 

           COMMENTATOR
    But Hunt is refusing! Simply ignoring 
    his team’s orders...! He’s made the 
    calculation that he can still hold 
    onto the lead...! 

INT. EASTON NESTON - SAME TIME

HESKETH and BUBBLES cover their eyes. Can’t look...

           BUBBLES
    James!! What are you doing???

           HESKETH
    I can’t bear it!

INT. JAMES’S CAR - JAPAN GRAND PRIX - SAME TIME

Suddenly, a Ferrari in JAMES’s wing mirror. Unmistakably, even 
in the spray, he can see the distinctive RED HELMET...

It’s NIKI. JAMES’s blood runs cold...

           JAMES
    No! No! NO!!!!

JAMES tries to fend NIKI off. Swerves this way and that. But 
his wounded car is now running at seventy per cent at best...

...and disaster!!! NIKI OVERTAKES HIM...

JAMES screams in agony and frustration. He’s lost it! And has 
no one to blame but himself! His own arrogance. And 
stubbornness. NIKI’s overtaken him! 

THE CHEQUERED FLAG.

JAMES roars past. Has finished in third place. But that is no 
consolation. NIKI has beaten him. As far as he’s concerned..

JAMES has lost. Lost everything.

EXT. PITS - DAY


JAMES’s car arrives in the pits. In a fury. At himself. For 
refusing to listen. What a disgrace. What shame. What a fool. 
But he is engulfed. JAMES gets out of his car, raging... 

           JAMES
    I’m sorry! 

But TEDDY MAYER is celebrating wildly. ALASTAIR CALDWELL, too. 
The world’s media descends on JAMES...

           MAYER
    Sorry?? What are you talking about?? 
    You did it! 

           JAMES
    What?

           MAYER
    You WON!! 


           JAMES
    Rubbish!! What about Niki?? He 
    overtook me!! I saw it!! A Ferrari 
    with a red helmet..

           MAYER
    That wasn’t Niki. That was Regazzoni.

           JAMES
    What???

           MAYER
    Niki withdrew. Said it was too 
    dangerous, refused to drive!! 
       (gestures)
    You’re Champion of the World, kiddo!

TEDDY MAYER takes JAMES’s number ‘11’ from the side of his 
car, and tears it in two, leaving number ‘1’.

JAMES’s face: as he realizes. Then explodes with happiness. 

INT. EASTON NESTON - DAY

HESKETH and BUBBLES cheer in celebration...

           HESKETH
    He did it! He bloody well did it!

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

A television plays in the Emergency Ward of the hospital. 
NURSIE catches sight of the victory, patients cheering and 
applauding...

NURSIE allows herself a smile.

INT. HOTEL - MANHATTAN - SAME TIME

BURTON is at the door in tuxedo, waiting to go. SUZY, dressed 
glamorously, smiles. 

           SUZY
    Well done, James..

Then turns the TV off. And follows BURTON out.

EXT. JAPAN GRAND PRIX - DAY


JAMES is embraced by CALDWELL and MAYER.

EXT. FUJI PADDOCK - HELICOPTER - SAME TIME

Across the race-track, the sound of helicopter blades turning. 
JAMES looks over to see...

NIKI in the helicopter with MARLENE and a PILOT. NIKI, now the 
ex-World Champion, looks over to see a triumphant JAMES 
surrounded by press, McLaren colleagues, etc  

           MARLENE
    Are you OK?

NIKI turns, takes MARLENE’s hand as he answers.

           NIKI
    Fine. It’s just one race.

The helicopter lifts into the air, and flies off...

EXT. PADDOCK - SAME TIME

JAMES watches as the helicopter carrying NIKI flies away, then 
turns to see... 

...the world’s press begins to descend on him, and the biggest 
party of JAMES HUNT’s life is about to begin..

In the background, the two JAPANESE DRIVERS are giving 
interviews again. They didn’t just survive, MASAHIRO HASEMI 
got the fastest lap of the race, and NORITAKE TAKAHARA came 
9th...

And at that moment, magically, the sun breaks through, and the 
snowy peak of Mount Fuji is finally revealed.

A QUICKFIRE MONTAGE


Of newspaper headlines, television talk shows, lucrative 
endorsements, TV commercials, sponsorship, public billboards. 

JAMES’s world championship victory has made him a rich man. 
His movie star looks make him an international STAR and 
marketing man’s dream. 

Girls, more girls, and even more girls. 


JAMES, dashing in a white suit, plays trumpet on the UK’s most 
famous talk show... 

EXT. RUNWAY - DAY

FADE TO BLACK:


We’re on the runway of an airport in Northern Italy. 

CAPTION: “THREE MONTHS LATER”

A stretch limousine pulls up on the tarmac.  

A still-drunk JAMES HUNT and several good-looking WOMEN, rowdy 
FRIENDS (and hangers-on) spill out of the limo... 

They cross the tarmac towards their waiting private jet, 
passing other jets, when JAMES stops. 

He’s seen something that has caught his eye. 

JAMES sends his FRIENDS on ahead to their waiting jet, and 
walks over to a small private jet, (a Learjet 35)...

           JAMES
    I heard you were spending more and 
    more time in one of these...

A hunched PILOT doing final checks. The figure turns. It’s 
NIKI. His wounds have healed a little, but it’s still a 
painful sight...

           NIKI
    Do you fly?

           JAMES
    No.

           NIKI
    You should try it. If something goes 
    wrong up there, you’re on the edge, 
    but have to stay within the rules. 
    Stick to regulations. Suppress the 
    ego. It’s good discipline for the 
    racing.   

           JAMES
    And there I was thinking you were 
    about to wax lyrical about the romance 
    of flight. I should have known better.

           NIKI
    What brings you here?

JAMES indicates his rowdy, cool-looking friends..

           JAMES
    A friend’s wedding. At least I think 
    it was a wedding. Might have been a 
    birthday. All a bit of a blur. How 
    about you? Been at Fiorano?

           NIKI
    Pre-season testing. 

           JAMES
    Already? In February? You’re 
    relentless.

           NIKI
    Thank you.

           JAMES
    I’m not sure I meant it as a 
    compliment.

           NIKI
    But it is one. Relentlessness is good. 
    Means you’re a fighter. That you never 
    give up. Behind my back I know some of 
    you guys call me ‘The Rat.’ Because I 
    look like one. It’s meant as an 
    insult. But I don’t mind it. Rats are 
    ugly, sure. And no one likes them. But 
    they’re intelligent. With a strong 
    survival instinct.

JAMES can’t help smiling. That’s NIKI.

           NIKI
    So when do you start testing? Next 
    week?

           JAMES
    Are you mad? I didn’t just win the 
    biggest thing of my life so I could 
    get right back to work. 

           NIKI
    Why? You need to. To prove to all the 
    people who will always say you only 
    won it because...

           JAMES
    Because what...? Because of your 
    accident? Is that other people, Niki? 
    Or you? I won. On the all important 
    day when it came down to it, we raced 
    on equal terms in equally good cars. 

           JAMES 
    You bottled and I had the guts to see 
    it through.

           NIKI
    It's true. You won that race. And 
    believe me if I had to lose that title 
    to anyone, I’m happy it was you. But 
    that doesn't change the fact you have 
    to win again.

           JAMES
    Why? 

           NIKI
    Because that’s what it means to be a 
    winner, no? It’s a permanent 
    condition. Never stops or goes away. 
    It stays with you always. 

           JAMES
    That’s winning? Sounds like losing to 
    me. Some of life needs to be for 
    pleasure, Niki. What's the use of 
    having a million cups and medals if 
    you never have any fun? How is that 
    winning?

The plane load of JAMES’s friends call out...”C’mon, James!” 

           NIKI
    You’re right. I could learn from you. 
    In hospital the toughest part of my 
    treatment was the vacuum. Pumping the 
    shit out of my lungs. It was agony. 
    While doing it, I was watching 
    television...you winning all those 
    races...and I was cursing you.. “That 
    bastard, Hunt”, I would shout, “I hate 
    that guy.” one day the doctor said, 
    “Mr. Lauda, may I offer one piece of 
    advice? Stop thinking of it as a curse 
    to have been given an enemy in life. 
    It can be a blessing, too.” I said, 
    “Who are you, Confucius?” He said, “A 
    wise man gets more from his enemies 
    than a fool from his friends.” And you 
    know, he’s right. Look at us. We were 
    a pair of kids when we first met. 
    Hotheaded jerks in Formula 3. Headed 
    nowhere. Now we’re both Champions of 
    the world. Not bad.

           JAMES
    No, not bad.

           NIKI
    So don’t let me down now. I need you 
    busting my balls. Get back to work. 

           JAMES
    I will, Niki. But I intend to enjoy 
    myself first. And so should you. You 
    think you can?

NIKI stares. A blank look.. 

           JAMES
    See you on race day, Champ. 

           NIKI
    You will. Champ. 

JAMES goes. NIKI watches him, pulled into his plane by his 
laughing, cool FRIENDS. An unmistakable flicker of envy in his 
eyes.

Then NIKI turns, alone, and resumes his safety checks.

EXT. RUNWAY - AIRFIELD - DAY

JAMES’s plane roars down the runway and takes off into the 
azure blue sky...

FADE TO BLACK:

CAPTION: “JAMES RETURNED THE FOLLOWING SEASON, BUT WAS NEVER A 
CHALLENGER AGAIN. HE RETIRED IN 1979. AFTER SHORT CAREERS IN 
BROADCASTING AND BUDGIE BREEDING HE DIED OF A HEART ATTACK. 
AGED 45.” 

CAPTION: “NIKI LAUDA WENT ON TO BECOME WORLD CHAMPION IN 1977. 
AND AGAIN IN 1984. HE NOW RUNS A SUCCESSFUL COMMERCIAL 
AIRLINE. HE STILL CLAIMS TO HAVE NO FRIENDS.”

The End
