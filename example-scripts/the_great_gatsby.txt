             The Great Gatsby

              Screenplay by

         Baz Luhrmann & Craig Pearce

               Based on

            The Great Gatsby 

                 By

           F. Scott Fitzgerald

A BLACK SCREEN.

The blackness is pierced by a single, pulsing green light...

We drift, as if by boat, across a dark bay toward the light.

Then, we hear a troubled voice.

             NICK 
      In my younger and more vulnerable 
      years my father gave me some 
      advice: “always try to see the best 
      in people,” he would say...

A gentle snow begins to fall, obscuring the light...

             NICK 
      As a consequence, I’m inclined to 
      reserve all judgements. 

The snow grows heavier.

             NICK 
      But even I... have a limit.

EXT. SANITARIUM - WINTER - DAY

Continue drifting, through the snow, across an icy lake...

DISSOLVE TO:

             NICK 
      Back then all of us drank too much.

DISCOVER: A stately Victorian building...

             NICK 
      The more in tune with the times we 
      were, the more we drank. 

CLOSE ON: The sign, “The Perkins Sanitarium.”

             NICK 
      And none of us contributed anything 
      new.

INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY

DISCOVER: A man shrouded in darkness. He leans against an old 
fireplace, hand covering his face. 


             NICK
      When I came back from New York I 
      was disgusted.

REVEAL: NICK CARRAWAY (37), unshaven, morbidly alcoholic. 

             NICK 
      Disgusted... with everyone, and 
      everything... Only one man was 
      exempt from my disgust.

REVEAL: A kind, elderly DOCTOR.

             DOCTOR
      One man...? Mr. Carraway?

             NICK
        (whispers)
      Gatsby...

             DOCTOR 
      Was he a friend of yours?

             NICK
      He was... the single most hopeful 
      person I have ever met... And am 
      ever likely to meet again. There 
      was something about him...

Nick wanders slowly towards the window, remembering.

             NICK 
      A sensitivity. He was like one of 
      those machines that register 
      earthquakes ten thousand miles 
      away... 

             DOCTOR
      Where did you meet him?

Nick stops and stares out the window, haunted.

             NICK
      At a party. In New York.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY

THROUGH THE CLOUDS: New skyscrapers pierce a clear blue sky.

             NICK 
      In the summer of 1922, the tempo of 
      the city approached hysteria... 

ON WALL STREET: A fever pitch of buying and selling...

             NICL 
      Stocks hit record peaks. And Wall 
      Street boomed, in a steady golden 
      roar...

IMAGES OF DECADENT NEW YORK FADE IN, ILLUSTRATING NICK’S V.O. 
Dancing girls, speakeasies, bootleg kings, fat cats counting 
fresh fortunes, and the stock market climbing up, up, up...!

             NICK 
      The parties were bigger; the shows 
      were broader; the buildings were 
      higher; the morals were looser; and 
      the ban on alcohol had backfired... 
      making the liquor cheaper.

FADE IN: A sea of boater hats crowds a Manhattan street.

             NICK 
      Wall Street was luring the young 
      and ambitious.

PUSH TOWARD: One of the hats. Its wearer stops, and gazes up.

             NICK 
      And I was one of them. 

REVEAL: A clear-eyed, hopeful, 29 year old Nick Carraway.

             NICK 
      I rented a house twenty miles from 
      the city, on Long Island.

DISCOVER: A unkempt bungalow, hemmed in by enormous mansions.

      of the newly rich.

INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - DAY

Nick is unpacking...

             NICK 
      To get started, I bought a dozen 
      volumes on credit, banking and 
      investments--

CLOSE ON: A row of heavy red and gold-bound bonds books. Nick 
plucks one up.

             NICK 
      All new to me...

And turns on the radio.

DISCOVER: Nick, speaking much more moderately.

             NICK
      Yes sir, of course nothing is one 
      hundred percent. Well, I wouldn’t

Nick, still unpacking, eyes a mountain of unpacked books...

             NICK 
      At Yale, I’d dreamed of being a 
      writer.

He resists the temptation to swap bonds books for literature.

             NICK 
      But I gave all that up.

EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - DAY

Nick emerges onto the porch, greeted by dazzling sunshine.

             NICK 
      With the sun shining and the great 
      bursts of leaves on the trees, I 
      planned to spend the summer 
      studying.

Nick sits and places his bonds book in front of him...

             NICK 
      And I probably would have--

When woman’s shriek startles him... 

NICK’S POV: On the neighboring beach a group of revellers are 
frolicking. A scantily girl clad waves and then disappears 
into the trees, drawing Nick’s eye to his neighbor’s house...

             NICK 
      Were it not for the riotous 
      amusements that beckoned from 
      beyond the walls of that colossal 
      castle... 

Through dense foliage Nick spies the mysterious spires and 
towers of the neighboring Gothic folly.

             NICK 
      Owned by a gentleman I had not yet 
      met, named...

In a high tower window, a curtain flutters ominously...

The Doctor concludes:

             DOCTOR
      So... He was your neighbor?

             NICK
      My neighbor? No, Gatsby was-- Well-- 
      If I think about it... The history 
      of the summer really began the 
      night I drove over to my cousin 
      Daisy’s for dinner...

An impressive Georgian mansion overlooks a quarter mile of 
lawn that cascades down to a private polo field.

             NICK 
      In old money East Egg.

BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! We hear a phone ringing off-screen.

FOLLOW: A polo player (TOM), as he gallops toward the house.

             NICK 
      Her husband was heir to one of 
      America’s wealthiest families.

BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG!

Tom whacks the polo ball...

             NICK 
      His name was Tom Buchanan.

The ball nearly hits one of Tom’s gardeners...

             NICK 
      When we were at Yale together he’d 
      been a sporting star.

BRINNNGGG! BRINNNGGG! 

Tom dismounts and bounds up the stairs to the porch...

             NICK 
      But now his glory days were behind 
      him and he contented himself 
      with... other affairs.

Tom aggressively grabs the telephone from HENRI, the butler, 
and turns; revealing an imposing, hard-mouthed man of thirty. 

             TOM
      I thought I told you not to call me 
      here...!

PULL FOCUS: Tom sees a servant escort Nick along the balcony. 

Clunking down the receiver, Tom strides toward Nick and 
grasps his hand with overbearing strength.

             TOM 
      Shakespeare! How’s the great 
      American novel coming...?

             NICK
      Oh, I’m selling bonds now Tom... 
      with Walter Chase’s outfit--

             TOM
      Never heard of em.

Tom slaps Nick with irritating heartiness!

             TOM 
      Hey! What say after dinner we go 
      into town? 

             NICK
      Can’t--

             TOM
      Catch up with the old wolf pack?

             NICK
      Big day on the new job tomorrow--

             TOM
      Nonsense! We’re going.

INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - HALL OF CHAMPIONS - LATE AFTERNOON

Tom leads Nick down a grand hall lined with the trophies that 
chronicle Tom’s infinite sporting achievements.

             TOM
      First team, all-American! 

Tom admires his own achievements.

             TOM 
      You see? Made me who I am today. 

Tom pulls his favorite trophy from the cabinet--

             TOM 
      Here-- Forest Hills... I played the 
      Prince of Wales. What a sissy! 

Tom exchanges the trophy for a football.

             TOM 
      Life’s something you dominate Nick.

He pelts Nick with the ball--

             TOM 
      If you’re any good. 

Nick fumbles as Tom charges him--

             TOM 
      Ha-ha-ha!

Tom tackles Nick, knocking him back, through a pair of 
vaulting doors, and into...

INT. BUCHANAN MANSION - SALON - LATE AFTERNOON 

A shimmering, sun-dazzled room in which enormous white 
curtains whip and snap in the breeze...

CLOSE ON: Nick, frozen, awestruck. 

We hear the giggle of naughty children...

BOOM!!! As the French doors shut, and the curtains fall, a 
beautiful white hand rises from behind the couch, and with 
it, a low, thrilling voice...

             DAISY 
      Oh Nicky... Is that you my lovely?

Suddenly, 23 year old DAISY BUCHANAN, appears from over the 
back of the couch. Her bright eyes and passionate mouth are 
framed by a strawberry-blonde bob. 

CLOSE ON: Daisy, captivating...

             NICK 
      Daisy Buchanan. The golden girl. A 
      breathless warmth flowed from her. 
      A promise that there was no one 
      else in the world she so wanted to 
      see...

She whispers dramatically...

             DAISY
      Do they miss me in Chicago?

             NICK
      Oh, yes. About a dozen people send 
      their love.

             DAISY
        (unimpressed)
      How gorgeous.

             NICK
      They’re absolutely in mourning... 
      They’re crying...

             DAISY
      No--

             NICK
      They’re wailing...

             DAISY
      No--

             NICK
      They’re screaming, they’re 
      shouting...

             DAISY
      No--

             NICK
      “Daisy Buchanan, we can’t live 
      without you!” 


             DAISY
      I'm p-paralyzed with happiness...!

Daisy takes Nick’s hand and squeals with childish glee as she 
drags him over the sofa and onto his back on the floor.

He stares up... And, a mysterious, athletic girl glares back. 
This is 22 year old, JORDAN BAKER.

             DAISY 
      Jordan Baker; a very famous golfer.

CLOSE ON: Nick, the blood drains from his face...

             NICK 
      She was the most frightening person 
      I’d ever seen--

Nick rights himself and extends his hand.

             NICK
      I’ve seen your face on the cover of 
      “Sporting Life”. Nick Carraway...

But Jordan merely yawns and stands (we get a good look).

             NICK 
      But I enjoyed looking at her.

             JORDAN
      I've been lying on that sofa for as 
      long as I can remember...

Daisy turns to Nick with scandalous delight.

             DAISY
      I know! This summer I'll sort of, 
      fling you and Jordan together...

As Tom prepares drinks at the bar, he glances skittishly at a 
white telephone set ostentatiously upon a marble pedestal.

             DAISY 
      I’ll push you into linen closets, 
      and out to sea in boats...

             JORDAN
      I’m not listening to a word!

Irritated, Tom turns to Nick.

             TOM
      Nick, Daisy tells me you’re over at 
      West Egg; 


             TOM
      throwing your lot in with those 
      social-climbing, primitive New 
      Money types...?

             NICK
      Well, my little shack is cardboard 
      box at eighty a month.

             DAISY
      Your life is adorable.

Jordan toys with a golf club, and speaks with bored contempt. 

             JORDAN
      I know somebody in West Egg.

             NICK
      I don't know a single--

Jordan turns dramatically.

             JORDAN
      Oh, you must know Gatsby.

Daisy, a sharp intake of breath.

             DAISY
      Gatsby? 

CLOSE ON: Daisy, as she struggles to control rising emotion.

             DAISY 
      What Gatsby...?

Before anyone can reply, Henri announces--

             HENRI
      Madame, le diner est servi!

As Jordan WHACKS a golf ball into a makeshift cup - a trophy 
on the floor - waiters sweep open the doors and the curtains 
flutter up again.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - TERRACE - NIGHT

Daisy, Nick, Jordan and Tom sit at a long, sumptuously laid 
table. Food, wine, laughter, smoking... 

DISSOLVING ABSTRACTLY: Through fragments of conversation...

             DAISY
      Would you like to hear a family 
      secret? Its about the butler’s 
      nose...

             JORDAN
      Things went from bad to worse...

             DAISY
      Nicky... I heard a rumor, that you 
      were getting married to a girl out 
      west...

             NICK
      Its a libel, I’m too poor.

             JORDAN
      They have to be old so they die 
      quickly...

             NICK
      Can’t we talk about something else? 
      Anything? Crops? You’re making me 
      feel uncivilized Daisy--

This draws a strangely violent interjection from Tom.

             TOM
      Civilization's going to pieces! 
      Have you read 'The Rise of the 
      Colored Empires' by this fellow 
      Goddard?

             NICK
      Why no...

Tom stands and begins to pace--

             TOM
      Everyone ought to read it. The idea 
      is that its up to us, the dominant 
      race, to watch out, or these other 
      races... 

Tom straightens the bow-tie on his black servant--

             TOM 
      Will have control of things. 

             DAISY
        (wickedly)
      Tom’s been very profound lately. He 
      reads deep books with long words in 
      them

             TOM
      It’s been proved. Its scientific.

             DAISY
        (subtly mocking Tom)
      We’ve got to beat them down.

SUDDENLY, BRINNNGGG! The telephone. All freeze. Another ring. 
BRINNNGGG!

             TOM
      Excuse me... I’ll be right back.

He goes inside.

An embarrassed moment; suddenly Daisy throws her napkin down.

             DAISY
      I’m sorry...

She follows Tom into the house.

Nick, at a loss, turns to Jordan. 

             NICK
      Well, this Mr. Gatsby you spoke of 
      is my neighbor... 

             JORDAN
      Shhhh... Don’t talk. I want to hear 
      what happens.

A subdued, impassioned murmur is audible in the room beyond. 

             NICK
      Is something happening?

             JORDAN
      I thought everybody knew.

             NICK

      I don’t.

             JORDAN
      Tom's got some woman in New York.

             NICK
      Got some woman?

             JORDAN
      She might have the decency not to 
      telephone at dinner-time... Don’t 
      you think?

Almost before Nick has grasped her meaning, the doors bang 
open and Tom and Daisy return to the table.

             DAISY
        (a tense gayety)
      I just love seeing you at my table 
      Nicky. You remind me of a rose, an 
      absolute rose... Doesn’t he?

             NICK
      I’m not even faintly like a rose--

             TOM
      So... After dinner Nick wanted to 
      go into town. Right Nick? To the 
      Yale club. 

             DAISY
      Nicky, stay--

             NICK
      I have to work early.

             TOM
      Nonsense. Its only for a drink or 
      two.

Daisy and Tom stare at Nick - both demanding his allegiance. 

SUDDENLY! The telephone rings again: BRINNNGGG! Again, all 
freeze. BRINNNGGG! 

PUSH IN: On Daisy as the telephone continues to shriek. 

             NICK 
      None of us could ignore that fifth 
      guest’s shrill metallic urgency...

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - BALUSTRADE - LATER

Servants clear. Jordan and Tom retire to the salon, as Nick 
and Daisy stroll down toward the water, and Daisy confides: 

             DAISY
      Oh Nicky...

             NICK
      What?

             DAISY
      Its just, well, you see, I think 
      everything’s terrible anyhow. You 
      know I’ve been everywhere and seen 
      everything and done everything, and 
      I’ve had very bad time Nicky... I’m 
      pretty cyncical about everything.

Daisy gazes melancholic across the bay; an awkward silence.

Nick tries to change the subject--

             NICK 
      Your daughter; I suppose she talks, 
      and... eats, and everything?

             DAISY
      Pammy? Oh yes...

Daisy leans on a stone balustrade and gazes down toward the 
dock, where a green light glows in the velvet dusk.

             DAISY 
      Listen Nick, when she was born, Tom 
      was God knows where - with God 
      knows whom - and I asked the nurse 
      if it was a boy or a girl. She told 
      me it was a girl, and I wept. 'All 
      right,' I said, 'I'm glad it's a 
      girl. And I hope she'll be a fool - 
      that's the best thing a girl can be 
      in this world, a beautiful little 
      fool.’

She breaks off, and looks at Nick with that smile of hers...

             DAISY 
      All the bright precious things fade 
      so fast...

And as a sad, sweet underscore plays, WE PUSH out over the 
water, and across the bay toward Gatsby’s castle... 

             DAISY 
      And they don’t come back.

EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - DOCK - NIGHT

WE DISCOVER: At the end of Gatsby’s dock, A MAN - his dark 
silhouette is cut against the paler black of the night sky. 

In the distance behind him we see headlights. It is Nick, 
pulling up at his bungalow.

EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

Nick gets out of his car. He stops. Through the trees, he can 
see The Man gazing intently across the bay. 

             NICK 
      When I arrived home I noticed that 
      a figure had emerged on my 
      neighbor’s dock.

Nick goes closer, and watches The Man...

             NICK 
      And something told me it was... Mr. 
      Gatsby.

The Man reaches out--

             NICK 
      He seemed to be... reaching toward 
      something out there in the dark.

A green light on dock pulses in the distant darkness...

INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - NIGHT

Nick, troubled...

             NICK
      The green light.

             DOCTOR
      Green light?

Nick struggles with a painful memory...

             NICK
      I don’t want to talk about this 
      Doctor.

Nick breaks off; and after a VERY LONG SILENCE, he admits:

             NICK 
      I can’t talk about THIS.

             DOCTOR
        (delicately)
      Then write about it.

             NICK
        (skeptical)
      Write?

             DOCTOR
      Yes. Write. 

             NICK
      Why would I do that?

             DOCTOR
      After all, you said that writing 
      brought you solace, once upon a 
      time.

             NICK
      Yeah, well. It didn’t bring anyone 
      else much solace... I wasn’t any 
      good.

The Doctor offers Nick a pen; but Nick does not accept.

             DOCTOR
      No one need ever read it. You can 
      always burn it.

             NICK
      What would I write about?

             DOCTOR
      Anything. Whatever you can’t quite 
      talk about; a memory; a thought; a 
      place... Write it down.

CLOSE ON: Nick considering the challenge...

             NICK
        (to himself)
      A place...

Slowly he takes the pen. 

We hear the clatter of metal wheels on train tracks; AS THE 
SCREEN FILLS WITH WORDS, we hear them as voice-over. 

             NICK 
      The Valley of Ashes was a grotesque 
      place...

EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY

HIGH AND WIDE: A vast dumping ground comprised of massive 
mounds of smoldering ash; train tracks cut through its heart 
and the gleaming towers of the city shimmer in the distance.

             NICK 
      New York’s dumping ground, half way 
      between West Egg and the city...

IMAGES illustrate the poverty and hopelessness of life here.

             NICK 
      ...Where the burnt out coal that 
      powered the booming, golden city 
      was discarded by men who moved 
      dimly and already crumbling through 
      the powdery air. 

A train waits at a drawbridge spanning a small, foul creek. 

DISCOVER: Nick, aboard the train, looking out at the awful 
wasteland...

             NICK 
      ...This fantastic farm was ever-
      watched by Dr. T. J. Eckleberg...

NICK’S POV: A gigantic paint peeling billboard reads: “Dr. 
T.J. Eckleberg.” 

             NICK 
      ...A forgotten oculist whose eyes 
      brooded over it all like the eyes 
      of God.

INT. TRAIN - DAY

Tom, flushed with booze and heat, glances covertly around the 
halted carriage. Nick sits opposite. 

             NICK 
      Tom had invited me to town, on the 
      pretense of a lunch at the Yale 
      Club.... 

As the carriage moves, Tom suddenly pulls Nick to his feet.

             NICK 
      But the day took an unexpected 
      turn...

Tom drags Nick from the moving train.

             TOM
      Come on--!

EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY

As the train pulls off, Nick, exasperates, chases Tom.

             NICK 
      What are we doing?

             TOM
      Trust me!

             NICK
      Wait a second would you!?

             TOM
        (calls back)
      Dominate Nick! Dominate!

PAN DOWN TO DISCOVER: Tom and Nick outside a small garage. 

A sign reads: “GEORGE B. WILSON. Cars Bought and Sold.”

INT. WILSON’S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

As Tom and Nick enter the dim garage, WILSON, a nervous, 
spiritless man, appears from the back office. 

             TOM
      Hello Wilson! How's business?

             WILSON
        (unconvincing)
      I can't complain. When are you 
      going to sell me that car?

             TOM
      I've got my man working on it.

             WILSON
      Works pretty slow, don't he?

             TOM
        (coldly)
      Maybe I'd better sell it somewhere 
      else?

             WILSON
      I don't mean that, I just...

Wilson’s grovelling is terminated by the sound of chunky red 
heels corkscrewing down stairs from above. All turn to see: 
MYRTLE WILSON. Buxom. Smoldering. Elementally sensual.

             MYRTLE
      If its business you’re talking, you 
      should be talking to me... 
        (to her husband)
      Get some chairs why don't you; so 
      somebody can sit down...

Myrtle smiles slowly and, walking through her husband as if 
he were a ghost, shakes hands with Tom.

             MYRTLE 
        (without turning)
      Hurry up!

             WILSON
      Oh, sure... Sure...

Wilson hurries out back. 

             TOM
      Mrs. Wilson... Nick Carraway.

             MYRTLE
      A pleasure...

             TOM
      Nick’s a writer...

Myrtle is completely uninterested.

             NICK
        (feeble)
      I’m in bonds, actually...

             TOM
        (intently to Myrtle)
      Get on the next train.

             MYRTLE 
        (playing hard to get)
      Now...? Are we gettin’ that dog?

             TOM
      Whatever you want. And you can call 
      up your sister...
        (glancing to Nick)
      She’ll like him...

             NICK
      Oh no, that’s alright, I’m busy... 

             MYRTLE
      Catherine’s said to be very good 
      looking, by people who oughta know. 

             NICK
      Really I can’t...

             TOM
        (whispers to Nick)
      Do you want to embarrass Myrtle...? 
      That’s rude.

CUT TO:

INT. MYRTLE’S APARTMENT - DAY

The muffled sounds of sex... 

CLOSE ON: A puppy mouthing a soggy dog biscuit that dissolves 
into a saucer of milk. 

Nick, horrified, perches on a couch in a small room stuffed 
with tacky, pretentious objects; obviously bought by Tom. 

Nick springs to his feet and yanks open the front door, only 
to be startled by a slender, louche girl in her twenties, 
with a sticky bob of red hair. This is CATHERINE.

She sweeps into the room, pivots, and extends her hand.

             CATHERINE
      I’m Catherine; ain’t we havin’ a 
      party?

             NICK
      Oh, I’m... I’m not sure now’s a 
      good time-- I was just going--

But Nick’s exit is blocked.

             MRS. MCKEE
      Hello...!

MRS. MCKEE, a shrill woman in her 30s, enters with MR. MCKEE - 
a feminine man with a bit of shaving cream on his cheek. 

             MR. MCKEE
        (extending his hand)
      Chester McKee, pleasure to meet 
      you.

             NICK
      Nick Carraway.


             MRS. MCKEE
      Where’re the kids?

Nick is still trying to leave, but Catherine corners him...

             CATHERINE
      What’s the matter? Don’t ya like 
      me?

SUDDENLY! The bedroom door whooshes open and Myrtle appears 
wearing an astounding, red jersey sheath dress.

             MRS. MCKEE
      Myrtle Turtle...! Oh, that dress is 
      adorable!

             MYRTLE
        (with impressive hauteur)
      It's just a crazy old thing. I slip 
      it on when I don't care what I look 
      like!

Tom appears behind Myrtle, arrogantly buttoning his shirt. 

             TOM
      Get some ice Myrtle, before 
      everyone goes to sleep.

Myrtle sweeps into the kitchen; Tom opens the liquor cabinet.

             NICK
        (making for the door)
      Tom, I really should be going...

             TOM
        (grabbing Nick’s arm)
      Nonsense... 

             NICK
      Tom; I don’t think-- Daisy’s my--

Tom pulls Nick back toward the party.

             TOM
      Listen Nick, you like to watch; I 
      remember that from college. And 
      that’s OK, I make no judgment; but 
      we’ve got a whole summer - do you 
      want to sit on the sideline and 
      watch, or do you want to play ball?

             CATHERINE
      Yeah. Ain’t we good enough for ya?

Catherine winks, pushes Nick into his chair, and fearlessly 
lands herself in his lap.


             CATHERINE 
      Take off yer hat and stay awhile...

             TOM
      Hey Nick! McKee’s in the artistic 
      game.

      No...

             MCKEE
      Really?

             NICK
      Ah, no, well, I write a little...

Tom clunks the gramophone needle onto a record and Catherine 
raises her voice above the music.

             CATHERINE
      Do you live on Long Island, too?

             NICK
      I live at West Egg.

             CATHERINE
      Really? I was there at a party 
      about a month ago. At a man named 
      Gatsby's. Do you know him? 

             NICK
      I live right next door to him...

             CATHERINE
      He's a cousin of Kaiser Wilhelm's. 
      You know, the evil German king...

CUT TO: Tom raising Myrtle’s skirt suggestively. 

             TOM
      Hey McKee, take a picture of that!

             MYRTLE
        (girlish glee)
      Oh, don’t! 
             MYRTLE
      I’m not one of those models...! But 
      you can if you want...

Catherine leans close and whispers in Nick’s ear.

             CATHERINE
      Neither of them can stand who 
      they're married to. 

             NICK
      Doesn’t she like Wilson either?

             MYRTLE
        (overhears)
      ...He’s a greasy little scumbag!

Tom grins arrogantly and offers a drink to Catherine.

             CATHERINE
      No thanks; I feel just as good on 
      nothing at all...

With a suggestive glimpse of tongue, Catherine pops a pill...

             CATHERINE 
      Nerve pills, I get them from a 
      doctor in Queens. You want one?

             NICK
      My nerves are fine thanks...

Catherine smiles mischievously, puts a pill on her tongue and 
suddenly kisses Nick... He splutters, but Catherine tips the 
scotch to his mouth, washing the pill down. 

             NICK 
      I had been drunk just twice in my 
      life and the second time was that 
      afternoon...

DISSOLVE TO: Blurry freakish images of time passing... The 
whiskey is in demand by all; Catherine dances a solo. The 
music is sexy, dirty, deafening. The images become wilder, 
nauseatingly violent...  

As Catherine undresses Nick...

             NICK 
      That night, in the hidden flat that 
      Tom kept for Myrtle, we were buoyed 
      by a sort of chemical madness, a 
      willingness of the heart that burst 
      thunderously upon us all... And 
      suddenly, I began to like New York.

As the puppy sits on the table groaning faintly through the 
smoke, Myrtle suddenly springs to her feet!

             MYRTLE
      ...I've got to get a massage, and a 
      wave, and a collar for the dog, and 
      one of those cute little ash-trays 
      where you touch a spring, and a 
      wreath with a black silk bow for 
      mother's grave!

Pivoting through the smoky air, Myrtle begins to strip...

             MYRTLE 
      My dear I'm giving you this dress! 

Myrtle strips as Mrs. McKee greedily lunges for the dress.

             MRS. MCKEE
      Adorable! Adorable!

SUDDEN CUT: Nick, very drunk, finds himself at the bathroom 
window, observing the infinite life of the city...

             NICK 
      High over the city our yellow 
      windows must have contributed their 
      share of human secrets to the 
      casual watcher in the street...

INT. SANITARIUM - NICK’S ROOM - WINTER - NIGHT

Nick, now alone, pen in hand, writes furiously.

             NICK 
      ...and I was him too, looking up 
      and wondering...

EXT. THE STREET BELOW MYRTLE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Nick, simultaneously in the street below, can see himself 
upstairs looking out from Myrtle’s window. 

             NICK 
      I was within and without; enchanted 
      and repelled by the inexhaustible 
      variety of life...

POETIC VISUAL: The Manhattan skyline - millions of lighted 
windows frame silhouettes of this inexhaustible humanity...


INT. MYRTLE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

SUDDENLY WE HEAR Tom violently yelling!

             TOM
      You’ve got no right to speak her 
      name!

Tom and Myrtle emerge from the bedroom half-dressed...

             MYRTLE
      Daisy! Daisy! Daisy! I'll speak it 
      whenever I want! Daisy! Dai--

SUDDENLY! A short, sharp movement, Tom breaks Myrtle’s nose! 

CLOSE ON: Nick. AS MYRTLE SCREAMS, BLOOD FLIES ACROSS THE 
ROOM IN ABSTRACT SLOW MOTION!

PULL OUT: Through the window; this drama becomes merely one 
more of the countless many that play out in this vast city...

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY

Nick’s been reading to the Doctor. He sits on the couch, many 
hand-written pages on his lap. He admits...

             NICK
      I have no clue how I got home.

EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - MORNING

Nick is still asleep. Harsh morning light.

CLOSE ON: His eyelids slowly flutter awake.

He realizes he’s been sleeping on the porch in his underwear.

             NICK 
      But I do know that I awoke with a 
      distinctly uneasy feeling...

His pants lie next to him, his shirt is on the railing, his 
jacket is in a tree, and his car is parked in the bushes...

A sudden feeling of disquiet makes Nick look up...

             NICK 
      ....that Gatsby was watching me.

INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR’S OFFICE - WINTER - DAY

The Doctor leans forward.

             DOCTOR
        (slightly incredulous)
      Watching you...?

             NICK
      Yes. He was watching me. In fact, I 
      know now that Gatsby was always 
      watching me...

             DOCTOR
      And how do you know that?

             NICK
      Because I got an invitation... I 
      was the only one. 

FADE IN IMAGE: An immaculate CHAUFFEUR, in uniform of robin's 
egg blue, stands on Nick’s doorstep, holding a silver tray on 
which rests an invitation...

             NICK
      No one, except me, every received 
      an actual invitation to Gatsby’s...

The words written on the invitation PUSH FORWARD: “Dear Mr. 
Carraway, the honor would be entirely mine, if you would 
attend my little party...”

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TWILIGHT

A line of limousines stretches from the lights of Manhattan 
towards Gatsby’s gates. 

             NICK 
      You see, the rest of New York 
      simply came, uninvited...

As an open-topped Rolls Royce motors through Gatsby’s gates, 
a roadster packed with rowdy revellers, swerves onto the 
verge and roars cheekily by... 

             NICK 
      The whole city packed into 
      automobiles and all weekend, every 
      weekend, ended up at Gatsby’s...


CRANE HIGH AND WIDE: Gatsby’s magnificent castle. Illuminated 
fountains line a driveway packed with limousines; crowds of 
glamorous people stream up the broad marble stairs.

EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - PORTICO - TWILIGHT

Dressed in white flannels, Nick offers his invitation to a 
doorman who shrugs.

             NICK 
      And I mean everyone: from every 
      walk of life, from every corner of 
      New York City, this kaleidoscopic 
      carnival spilled through Gatsby’s 
      door... 

A gaggle of gorgeous, but obviously low-class girls, 
carelessly sweep Nick through the portico and into...

INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - HALL OF MASTERS - CONTINUOUS

A bizarre mix of characters surge toward light at the end of 
this dark, vaulting, vomitorium-like passageway. BANG! Doors 
burst open; the dazzling spectacle of the Grand Ballroom...!

INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - TWILIGHT

Champagne fountains vault to the ceiling. At the base of the 
fountains waiters scoop finger-bowl sized glasses onto trays.

Nick, almost unable to believe his eyes, takes in the 
impossible variety of guests at Gatsby’s...

             NICK
      A caravansary of...

IMAGES OF THE VARIOUS CHARACTERS illustrate his voice-over...

             NICK 
      Billionaire play-boy publishers, 
      and their blond nurses... Heiresses 
      comparing inheritances on Gatsby’s 
      beach... My boss, Walter Chase, 
      losing money at the roulette 
      tables... Gossip columnists... 
      Alongside gangsters and governors 
      exchanging telephone numbers... 
      Silent film stars... Broadway 
      directors... Morality protectors... 
      Casino collectors... 

             NICK
      Underage hecklers... And Ewing 
      Klipspringer, dubious descendent of 
      Beethoven!

Overwhelmed, and out-of-place, Nick approaches the bar...

             NICK 
        (to the bartender)
      Do you know where I might find the 
      host, Mr. Gatsby?

He brandishes his invitation.

             NICK 
      I live just next door...

             BARTENDER
      Mr. Gatsby? I’ve never seen him 
      sir. Why, no one has...

The bartender automatically hands Nick a martini.

             NICK 
      Alone, and a little embarrassed, I 
      decided to get... roaring drunk.

He downs the martini in one gulp, steps over an even drunker 
guest, who collapses at his feet, and makes his way out to:

EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TERRACE - TWILIGHT

Nick gazes out over the impossibly decadent party...

             NICK
	     Wow.

As, unbeknownst to him, a mysterious, masked guest stalks 
toward him from behind...

             VOICE 
      I thought I might see you here...

Startled, Nick turns to find... Jordan Baker.

Jordan seductively leads Nick down the terrace steps...

             NICK
      Did you get an invitation?

             JORDAN
      People aren’t invited to Gatsby’s.

             NICK 
      Well I was... I seem to be the only 
      one. Who is this Gatsby?

A haughty East Egger, TEDDY, interjects...

             TEDDY
      He was a German spy during the war. 

             JORDAN
      Teddy Barton. Nick Carraway.

             NICK
        (to Teddy)
      A German spy...? 

Teddy’s annoying East Egger friend, NELSON, chimes in...

             NELSON
      No, no, no, no. He’s the Kaiser’s 
      assassin.

And the third of the East Egger trio, LANGUID GIRL, adds...

             LANGUID GIRL
      I heard he killed a man once. 

             NELSON
      Its true!

             LANUID GIRL
      You look at him sometimes when he 
      thinks no one’s watching... I’ll 
      bet he killed a man.

             TEDDY
      Kills for fun! Free of charge.

             NELSON
      Well he’s already richer than God.

Nick turns to Jordan; an alarmed whisper.


             NICK
      You don’t believe he killed a man 
      do you...?

             JORDAN 
        (wickedly)
      Let’s go find him, and you can ask 
      him yourself... 

As the dance-floor erupts, and world-famous dancer Gilda Grey 
is announced, Jordan leads Nick off...

INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - EVENING

MUSIC FEVERISHLY BUILDS! As Nick and Jordan bound up a 
winding staircase, Jordan teases seductively...

             JORDAN
      Oh, Mr. Gatsby...! 
        (to Nick)
      Shall I lead you into his clutches?

INT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - LIBRARY - EVENING

BANG! Nick and Jordan explode into a dark room. A stout, 
middle-aged man wheels to them with unsettling intensity.

             OWL EYES
      You won’t find him...!

He plucks two finger-bowl sized cocktails from a row lined up 
on the table and hands them to Nick and Jordan.

             OWL EYES 
      This house and everything in it, 
      are all part of an elaborate 
      disguise. But Mr. Gatsby doesn’t 
      exist. 

             JORDAN
      Phooey; I’ve met him!

             OWL EYES
      Which one; the Prince, the Spy, the 
      Murderer? I’ve been wandering his 
      halls drunk for about a week now - 
      but no matter where I look, I can’t 
      find anyone who knows anything real 
      about Mr. Gatsby.


             JORDAN
        (blithely dismissive)
      Well I don’t care; he gives large 
      parties - and I like large parties, 
      they’re so intimate; at small 
      parties there isn't any privacy.

             NICK
        (slowly to Owl Eyes)
      But if that’s true; what’s all this 
      for...?

             OWL EYES
      That, my dear fellow, is the 
      question...

Owl Eyes looks to the window; and Nick and Jordan follow his 
gaze to... Gatsby’s garden, where, as the band hits fever 
pitch, and twilight becomes night... THE PARTY HAS BEGUN!!!!

EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT

As the music nears its final crescendo, the evening’s many 
fantastical characters dance uproariously around the pool!!!

On an elaborate flotilla in the center of it all Jordan and 
Nick are kicking a wild Charleston. The number finally peaks!

             NICK
      I didn’t expect all this...

             JORDAN
        (coy)
      What did you expect? 

             NICK
      I don’t know...

             JORDAN
      Disappointed?

             NICK
      Not in the slightest...

Jordan and Nick look as if they might just kiss...

             TEDDY
        (to Nick)
      Penny-less pantywaist!

Teddy leers between them and pulls Jordan away...

             TEDDY 
      I’m stealing her away Carraway!

Over wild applause, the ORCHESTRA LEADER announces...

             ORCHESTRA LEADER
      Ladies and gentlemen, please make 
      your way to the grand terrazzo; for 
      the premiere of Mr. Vladimir 
      Tostoff's “A Jazz History of the 
      World”, and accompanying fireworks!

Nick follow Jordan, but Teddy cuts him off--

             TEDDY
      Look around you! Rich girls don’t 
      marry poor boys--

On cue, a drinks tray floats into frame. There is a flurry of 
movement... Teddy rudely snatches a couple of martinis...

Nick, disoriented and empty-handed, begins up the stairs, and 
as he does so, hears the voice of the man holding the tray...

             MAN
      Your face is familiar. Weren't you 
      in the Third Division during the 
      war?

             NICK
      Yes; The Ninth Battalion.

CUT TO: THE MAN. He is tanned and handsome; just past thirty.

             MAN
      I was in the Seventh. I knew I'd 
      seen you somewhere before... Having 
      a good time, old sport? 

             NICK
        (very tipsy)
      The whole thing’s incredible - I 
      live next door...
        (brandishing his now 
         crumpled invitation)
      He even sent me an invitation, but 
      I still haven’t met Mr. Gatsby, no 
      one’s met him; they say he’s third 
      cousin to the Kaiser and second 
      cousin to the devil!

At the landing, half way up the steps, the man takes a drink 
from a waiter’s tray and hands it to Nick...

             MAN
      I’m afraid I’m not a very good 
      host, old sport... I’m Gatsby.

CLOSE ON: Nick - his face drops.

             NICK
        (muttering apologies)
      Oh.. I’m very sorry-- I... I’ve had 
      so much to drink...

The delirious opening chords of Tostoff’s “History” coincide 
with a gorgeous explosion of fireworks in the night sky!

             GATSBY
        (apologetically)
      I thought you knew, old sport.

Gatsby smiles a dazzling smile; sound fades to a serene hum.

             NICK 
      His smile was one of those rare 
      smiles that you may come across 
      four or five times in life. It 
      seemed to understand you and 
      believe in you just as you would 
      like to be understood and believed 
      in.

All at once the bubble bursts, a silver-haired, fifty-ish man 
in an immaculate tail-suit, (HERZOG) leans into Gatsby.

             HERZOG
      Excuse me sir; Chicago on the wire.

Gatsby nods, but before he departs he smiles at Nick.

             GATSBY
      I’m trying out my new hydroplane in 
      the morning. Want to go with me, 
      old sport? 

Nick shakes himself from his reverie.

             NICK

      What time?

             GATSBY
      Any time that suits you.

Gatsby turns, and catches for the first time, Jordan.

             GATSBY 
      Lovely to see you Miss Baker. 


He kisses her lightly on the hand.

             GATSBY 
        (to Nick)
      If you need anything, just ask for 
      it, old sport. I will rejoin you 
      later... Excuse me.

As Nick watches Gatsby walk away, he whispers with amazement.

             NICK
      I expected him to be...

             JORDAN
      Old and fat?

             NICK
      Well, yes; young men don’t just 
      drift coolly out of nowhere and buy 
      a palace on Long Island. 

             JORDAN
      He told me once he was an Oxford 
      man. However, I don't believe it...

             NICK
      Why not?

             JORDAN
      I don’t know... I just don’t 
      believe he went there...

Jordan is interrupted by a voice.

             HERZOG
      I beg your pardon...

She and Nick jump to find Herzog suddenly beside them.

             HERZOG 
      Miss Baker; Mr. Gatsby would like 
      to speak to you... Alone.

             JORDAN
        (surprised)
      Me?

             HERZOG
      Yes, madame.

As Vladimir Tostoff’s erotic, ominous chords build, Jordan 
crosses the now empty dance floor toward the silhouette of 
Gatsby in the library window...

Nick, unsettled, watches her go...

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATER

Alarmingly drunk girls sprawl at the feet of the grand piano. 
Klipspringer plays, a weeping woman attempts to slur along, 
and as a dejected Nick passes them toward the front stairs, 
the library door opens, and Jordan emerges alone...

Seeing Nick, she rushes to him...

             JORDAN
      Nick! Nick! I've just heard the 
      most shocking thing; it all makes 
      sense...

Teddy and the other East Eggers accost Jordan.

             TEDDY
      Where have you been!? The car’s 
      waiting!

Jordan is dragged out the door... Nick, on tenterhooks 
follows, as Jordan calls back...

             JORDAN
      Simply amazing! It all makes sense. 
      It all makes sense...

EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - NIGHT

The night has devolved into drunken mayhem as cars jam the 
driveway and intoxicated guests search for their vehicles.

Nick chases Jordan down the marble stairs.

             NICK
      What makes sense...? 

             JORDAN
      Everything... But here I am 
      tantalizing you...

The East Eggers and Jordan pile into their limousine. Jordan, 
a mysterious smile as she leans out the window.

             JORDAN 
      And I swore I wouldn’t tell.

             NICK
      But...

             JORDAN
      Nick. I’m sorry, I swore I wouldn’t 
      tell.

The car takes off and Nick is left staring; mystified... 

A voice startles him.

             GATSBY
      Sorry to keep her from you, old 
      sport. Don't forget; we're going up 
      in the hydroplane tomorrow morning.

Herzog appears behind Gatsby.

             HERZOG
      Philadelphia on the phone, sir.

Gatsby nods, then smiles that intoxicating smile.

             GATSBY
      Good night, old sport... 

             NICK
      Good night. Thank you.

Gatsby nods warmly, and turns inside. 

As Nick walks away he is confronted by a bizarre scene: a big 
crowd gathers around a COUPÉ, resting on its side in a ditch.

SUDDENLY! Owl Eyes pops from the wreck. He leers drunkenly...

             OWL EYES
      Whazza matter!? We run outta gas!?

The beep of a horn catches Nick’s attention. Jordan, leaning 
out of the window of her car as it sweeps away, calls to him.

             JORDAN
      Come and see me... We’ll have tea! 
      I’m in the phone-book!

Nick waves, smiles, and cuts across the lawn.

CLOSE ON: Nick. As he reaches the stone-pass separating his 
yard from Gatsby’s, he stops; a familiar feeling...

INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - TOWER - CONTINUOUS

High up in the window, the shadowy figure of Gatsby stands, 
phone pressed to his ear, watching Nick. After a moment, he 
raises his hand in formal farewell.


             NICK
      We rode in the hydroplane... And I 
      attended two more of his parties, 
      even made use of his beach. But I 
      soon realized that I knew 
      absolutely nothing about Gatsby at 
      all, until...

INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - MORNING

Nick is eating breakfast, studying bonds, when his glass of 
orange juice begins to rattle and shake.

Puzzled, Nick hurries to the window...

EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS

Gatsby’s yellow Duesenberg hurtles up Nick’s drive and skids 
to a stop. 

Nick emerges to his porch.

Gatsby leaps out!

             GATSBY
      Its pretty isn’t it, old sport...? 
      Haven’t you seen it before? Its all 
      a custom job. Supercharged engine. 
      Get dressed... We’re having lunch!

SLAM CUT TO:

I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - LONG ISLAND COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

The Duesenberg whips and winds along a tree-lined road... 
Gatsby, beyond nervous, drives with reckless intensity.

             GATSBY
      Ah... well... Ah... Look here, old 
      sport... What's your opinion of me, 
      anyhow?

             NICK
      My... opinion?

             GATSBY
      Yes, yes, your opinion!

Gatsby yanks the wheel; Nick hangs on for dear life!


             GATSBY 
      I don't want you to get the wrong 
      impression from all those bizarre 
      accusations you must be hearing. A 
      pack of lies I assure you. You’ve 
      heard the stories...?

             NICK
      Well--

             GATSBY
      I’ll tell you God’s truth. God’s 
      truth about myself!
        (raises right hand)
      I am the son of some very wealthy 
      people from the Middle-West; sadly, 
      all dead now... I was brought up in 
      America, but educated at Oxford; 
      because all my ancestors have been 
      educated there for many years. You 
      see, it’s a... a family tradition.

As Gatsby’s speech continues at breakneck speed... Nick’s 
V.O. fades up.

             NICK 
      The way he spoke... No wonder 
      people thought he was lying...

             GATSBY
      After that I lived like a young 
      Prince in all the capitals of 
      Europe!

             NICK
      Europe?

Barrelling around a blind turn, Gatsby wrenches at the wheel 
and maniacally overtakes a truck laden with farmhands...

             GATSBY
      Yes, Europe! Paris; Venice; Rome; 
      Vienna, Zurich, Helsinki... 
      Collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, 
      hunting big game, painting, a 
      little, things for myself mostly, 
      and trying to forget something very 
      sad that happened to me long ago...


PAN UP: The Duesenberg rockets forth; in the far distance the 
lush green countryside cedes to the lifeless Valley of Ashes.

                              DISSOLVE TO:

I/E. GATSBY’S CAR/THE VALLEY OF ASHES - DAY

Gatsby hasn’t stopped for breath...

             GATSBY
      Then came the war, old sport... 

             NICK 
      Just when I thought it couldn’t be 
      any more fantastical...

             GATSBY
      It was a great relief and I tried 
      very hard to die, but I seemed to 
      bear an enchanted life...

             NICK 
      He became a war hero, single-
      handedly defeating the German army!

CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He speaks with sudden, subdued emotion.

             GATSBY
      In the Argonne Forest I took my 
      machine gun detachment so far 
      forward... We were outnumbered five 
      to one. There was a half mile gap 
      on either side of us where the 
      infantry couldn’t advance.  We 
      stayed there two days and two 
      nights, 130 men with only 16 Lewis 
      guns...

Something catches Nick’s eye...

NICK’S POV: Myrtle Wilson pumps gas outside Wilson’s Garage. 

             GATSBY 
      ...When the infantry came up at 
      last they found the insignia of 3 
      German divisions among the piles of 
      the dead.

SCREEECHHH!!! Gatsby slams to halt at the train crossing!

             GATSBY 
      I was promoted to Major and every 
      Allied government gave me a 
      decoration; even Montenegro! Little 
      Montenegro down on the Adriatic 
      Sea.

SLAM! A medal is suddenly in Nick’s lap.

             GATSBY 
      Here! That’s the one from 
      Montenegro.

It looks authentic.

             GATSBY 
      Turn it.

             NICK
        (reads)
      Major Jay Gatsby. For Valor 
      Extraordinary.

             GATSBY
      That’s right.

SLAP! A photograph joins the medal.

             GATSBY 
      Here’s another thing that I always 
      carry. A souvenir of my Oxford 
      days; the man on my left is now the 
      Earl of Doncaster.

CLOSE ON: The photograph. Young men in blazers loaf in front 
of Oxford College. Gatsby stands with a cricket bat in hand.

             NICK 
      What could I say...? The photograph 
      was undoubtedly authentic. Could it 
      all be true?

DING! The gate lifts. And as Gatsby peels out, towards New 
York, he continues...

             GATSBY 
      But don’t take my word for it. At 
      lunch, I’m going to introduce you 
      to one of New York’s most 
      distinguished businessmen; my 
      friend, Mr. Meyer Wolfsheim, who 
      will confirm all I’ve told you, and 
      vouch for my good character...

I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - ASTORIA - DAY

Gatsby weaves between the pylons of the elevated highway.

             NICK
      I’m sure that’s not necessary...

Gatsby wheels to Nick, smiling with charming intensity.

             GATSBY
      Oh but it is though...! You see, I 
      thought you ought to know something 
      about my life. I... I don’t want 
      you to think I’m just some... some 
      nobody. You see, old sport, I’m 
      going to make a very big request of 
      you today. 

             NICK
      A big request?

             GATSBY
      Yes. Yes... Miss Baker will explain 
      everything when you take her to tea 
      this afternoon.

             NICK
        (caught off guard)
      Jordan...? What’s she got to do 
      with it?

             GATSBY
      Oh, I assure you it’s nothing 
      underhand. Miss Baker’s an honest 
      sportswoman; she’d never do 
      anything that wasn’t alright...

RRIIIRRRAA! A shrieking police siren! Before Gatsby can 
continue, a MOTORCYCLE COP pulls alongside.

             COP
      Pull over!!! Pull over to the curb!

             GATSBY
        (calmly)
      All right, old sport! Alright. 

Without slowing, Gatsby takes a card from his pocket...

             COP
        (embarrassed)
      Right you are... Know you next 
      time, Mr. Gatsby. Excuse me!

The cop peels off; and the Duesenberg, carrying an absolutely 
mystified Nick, rockets towards the Queensboro Bridge!

             NICK
      One of your old Oxford pals?

             GATSBY
      Well... actually, I was able to do 
      the Commissioner a favor once; he 
      sends a Christmas card every year.
        (adds proudly)
      I imagine he’ll be at lunch too...

             NICK
      By the time we reached the bridge I 
      was impossibly confused...

Nick turns to see: A Rolls Royce in which two stylish AFRICAN 
AMERICAN MEN and a WOMAN haughtily quaff champagne. They are 
driven by a WHITE CHAUFFEUR.

An orchestral melody surges...

             NICK 
      I didn’t know what to think... But
      the city seen from the Queensboro 
      Bridge is always the city seen for 
      the first time, in its first wild 
      promise of all the mystery and the 
      beauty in the world. Anything can 
      happen now that we've slid over 
      this bridge, I thought; anything at 
      all...

As the orchestra builds, Gatsby’s car shoots into Manhattan, 
through Times Square and beneath the famous advertisement of 
the man in the Arrow shirt. We follow, sweeping high over 
skyscrapers. The Duesenberg pulls up on the street below...

SUDDENLY THE CAMERA PLUMMETS with startling velocity...

             NICK 
      Even Gatsby could happen...

BAAAAM! A fat beat kicks as we explode through a grate, into:

INT. THE ANGRY DIAMOND SPEAKEASY - DAY

The sweaty grind of music shakes the air. On stage a pianist, 
THE PROFESSOR, bangs out a sizzling tune! 

PULL THROUGH A DOUBLE-GLASS MIRROR INTO:

INT. DICK DIVER’S CUTS BARBERSHOP - CONTINUOUS

DISCOVER: Nick and Gatsby entering the cramped shop...

In the center of the room a tall, distinguished, grey-bearded 
man in an exquisitely cut suit, and with gold rings on every 
finger, is having a beard trim. This, is MEYER WOLFSHEIM.

             WOLFSHEIM
      Ah my boy...! 

They embrace.

             GATSBY
      Meyer, Meyer...

             WOLFSHEIM
      You smell so good.

             GATSBY
      Mr. Carraway; my friend, Mr. 
      Wolfsheim.

Gatsby guides Nick and Wolfsheim toward the back of the shop.

             WOLFSHEIM
      A wonderful pleasure, Mr. Carraway.  
      I know all about you.

             NICK
      Really?

             WOLD
      Of course! Mr. Gatsby is always 
      talking about you. 

Gatsby raps a coded knock on a hidden door at the back of the 
shop. The door slides open, the rumble of music pours out...

             WOLFSHEIM
        (sinister)
      Come, join us for a little lunch...

INT. THE ANGRY DIAMOND SPEAKEASY - CONTINUOUS 

Gatsby ushers Wolfsheim and Nick down narrow creaking stairs, 
through the crowd and into the smoke-filled speakeasy...

ECU: Nick, taking in his NEW, SEEDY surroundings.

             WOLFSHEIM
        (whispers to Gatsby)
      Tell Walter Chase; “he shuts his 
      mouth or he doesn’t get a penny...”

             GATSBY
      We’ll talk about that later...

The HEAD WAITER appears.

             HEAD WAITER
      Highballs, Mr. Gatsby?

             GATSBY
      Yes, highballs it is. 
        (points to Nick)
      You take good care of my friend 
      here!

A portly man of obvious stature, surrounded by scantily clad 
flappers, yells from a corner booth.

             COMMISSIONER
      Hey Jay...! You’re under arrest!!!

Gatsby smiles and tips his hat.

             GATSBY
      You be careful now. You’re turning 
      into a real Jazz-Hound 
      Commissioner.
        (to Nick)
      See, that’s the Commissioner back 
      there.

Gatsby, the king here, greets patrons high and low...

He sees SENATOR GULICK at the craps table.

             GATSBY 
      You be careful at those tables now 
      Senator!

             SENATOR GULICK
      Of course! I’ll put a bet on for 
      you Jay!

Waiters clear a front row table - best seat in the house - 
Gatsby helps Wolfsheim to his. Wolfsheim eyes the girls on 
the stage.

Gatsby flashes Nick a charming smile.


             GATSBY
      Shall we order?
        (to the waiter)
      Lobster tails all round.
        (to Nick)
      They decorate it with truffle 
      slices and fine herbs. Very 
      artistic.

Wolfsheim glances to Gatsby, and then turns again to Nick...

             WOLFSHEIM
      So... How is the bond business Mr. 
      Carraway? 

             NICK
      It’s fine, thank you.

             WOLFSHEIM
      I understand you’re looking for a 
      business gonnegtion--

             GATSBY
      No, no. This isn't the man. This is 
      the friend I told you about. 

             WOLFSHEIM
      Oh! Beg your pardon, I had a wrong 
      man.

Woldsheim pats Nick on the back, unsettling him further...

Gatsby, a quick glance to his watch and Wolfsheim, jumps up.

             GATSBY
      Now, if you’ll excuse me. I have to 
      make THAT call.
        (gesturing to Nick)
      Meyer, do you mind?

Gatsby leaving Nick and Wolfsheim alone.

             WOLFSHEIM
      Gatsby! What a gentleman! From one 
      of the finest families in the 
      Midwest... Sadly all dead now. Let 
      me tell you, when I made the 
      pleasure of Mr. Gatsby’s 
      acquaintance just after the war, I 
      knew I had discovered a man of fine 
      breeding. A war hero! Such... 
      medals. And, an Oggsford man. 
      Oggsford College in England. You 
      know Oggsford?


             NICK
      I've heard of it...

             WOLFSHEIM
      Then you would know that a man like 
      that can be trusted. With a friend, 
      with someone like you, he would 
      never so much as look at your 
      wife...

             NICK
      I’m not... married.

             WOLFSHEIM
      But you work on Wall Street, right?

             NICK
        (totally confused)
      Yes...

Nick studies Wolfsheim, noticing an oddity about his outfit.

             WOLFSHEIM
      Looking at my tiepin?

CLOSE ON: The pin.

             WOLFSHEIM 
      Finest specimen of human molars...

Before Nick can recover, Gatsby suddenly returns.

             GATSBY
      Gentlemen. Everything alright...?

             NICK
      Oh, yes... We were just talking 
      about other people’s wives...

             GATSBY
        (taking his seat)
      Other people’s wives? Ah... I see.

Gatsby looks to Wolfsheim.

             GATSBY 
      Other people’s wives... Meyer?

Wolfsheim nods, smiles, and checks out the dancing girls...

             WOLFSHEIM
      Well, my work here is done. I’ll 
      leave you gentlemen to talk about 
      your sports and your women...


Wolfsheim follows his favorite dancer off...

             GATSBY
      You’ll have to excuse him... In his 
      old age, he’s prone to “digress...” 
      He’s a regular around here; a real 
      denizen of Broadway...

             NICK
      Who is he anyhow?

             GATSBY
      Meyer? He’s a gambler.

Over Nick and Gatsby’s shoulders is Wolfsheim, mingling with 
the ladies; but occasionally glancing in their direction...

             NICK

      An actor?

             GATSBY
      Meyer? No. He’s the man who fixed 
      the 1919 World Series.

             NICK
      Fixed it?

             GATSBY
      Fixed it.

             NICK
      How did he manage that?

             GATSBY
      He just... saw the opportunity, I 
      suppose. He’s a very smart man.
        (tries to change subject)
      Now, old sport, about Miss Baker, 
      and that request we spoke of...

Before Gatsby can go on, Tom Buchanan looms over the table.

             TOM
      Hey Nick! Nick! Where’ve you been!? 
      Daisy’s furious you haven’t called 
      up.

Nick and Gatsby stand.

             NICK
      This is Mr. Gatsby, Mr. Buchanan.

CLOSE ON: Gatsby. With strange intensity he offers his hand. 

             GATSBY
      I’m so very, very... delighted to 
      make your acquaintance.

Tom turns back to Nick.

             TOM
      I wouldn’t have expected to find 
      you in this temple of virtue. 

             NICK
      I'm having lunch with Mr. Gats--

Nick turns, but inexplicably, Gatsby is gone. 

PUSH TOWARD: Nick, surprise rising into anger...

CUT TO:

EXT. THE HOTEL SAYRE - ROOFTOP GARDEN - DUSK

Jordan is perched at an elegant table, overlooking Times 
Square and the advertisement of the man in the beautiful 
Arrow shirts.

famous...

             NICK
      I’m looking for Ms. Baker. Yes. The 
      famous sporting star. The golfer... 
      There... I’ve spotted her.

Nick comes to an abrupt halt in front of Jordan.

             NICK 
      What game are you and Gatsby 
      playing at!?

An immaculate MAITRE’D offers Nick a chair.

             MAITRE’D
      Will the gentleman be joining?

             NICK
        (frustrated)
      One moment please--

             JORDAN
      Please, Nick, sit down. This is a 
      polite restaurant.

As Nick’s frustration and Jordan’s embarrassment grow--


             NICK
      It’s all very strange. He picks me 
      up in his fancy yellow car... And 
      he’s going on and on and on about 
      his life and the war and rubies and 
      Oxford and... What is--

             JORDAN
      If you’ll just have a seat-- 

             NICK
      What is this big request!?

             JORDAN
      Nick--! He just wants you to invite 
      Daisy to tea.

             NICK
      Tea?

        (not what Nick expected)
      Daisy...? And Gatsby...?

Nick sits...

             NICK 
      Why?

             JORDAN
      Well... I don’t know quite where to 
      start. You see... I met Gatsby, 
      five years ago, in Louisville...

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DAISY’S HOUSE - LOUISVILLE - DAY

TIGHT ON: Golf shoes biting into soft, green grass.

             JORDAN 
      It was the day I got my new English 
      golf shoes.

WIDE: A row of fancy Louisville homes - red, white and blue 
bunting “tut, tutting” in the breeze - are set along a 
beautiful, green stretch of park. 

             JORDAN  
      Daisy was by far the most popular 
      girl with the Officers from Camp

Across the road, 18 YEAR OLD DAISY is perched in the front 
seat of her flashy white roadster, beaming, happy...

      her.

Beside Daisy REVEAL: A handsome lieutenant: YOUNG JAY GATSBY.

      It was Gatsby. And the way he

The silhouettes of Jordan and Nick, leaned close, are lit 
magnificently against the beaded lights of the city...

             JORDAN 
      Is the way all girls want to be 
      looked at.

Their eyes meet; a conspiring flicker.

             NICK
        (blown away)
      So what happened? 

             JORDAN
      Well, I don’t know... 

EXT. FRENCH BATTLEFIELD - DAY

Gatsby leads his men on a heroic charge out of the trenches--

      Gatsby was sent off to war...

A MASSIVE EXPLOSION rocks the battlefield!

INT. SEELBACH HOTEL - DAISY’S GRAND SUITE - NIGHT

An exquisite string of pearls coils around Daisy’s neck.

      He gave her a string of pearls 
      worth $350,000.

REVEAL: Tom, tightening the clasp.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SEELBACH HOTEL. DAISY’S GRAND SUITE - MORNING

             JORDAN 
      But, the morning of the wedding, 
      Daisy received a letter...

On the bed, Daisy, hysterical, clutches a bottle in one hand 
and a letter in the other.

             DAISY
        (screams)
      Tell them Daisy’s changed her mind!

             JORDAN
      Daisy! Please, everyone’s waiting!

Daisy reaches for the pearls around her neck...

             YOUNG DAISY
      Give them back!! 

Suddenly! Daisy tears the pearls and hurls them; they explode 
into a hundred shimmering pieces against the hard wood floor!

CUT TO: A set of stern, white heels clicking down the hall...

REVEAL: Daisy’s hard-mouthed MOTHER.

             DAISY’S MOTHER
      What on earth is going on in here!?

her mother’s eyes land on the bottle, and then the letter...

PUSH IN: The last line of the letter reads: Love, Jay.

      What was in the letter?

A deep breath, a last look, and then, Daisy opens her hand... 

The letter comes to pieces like snow.

             JORDAN 
      I don’t know. She wouldn’t tell me.

But before the letter disappears completely we read one more 
line: “The truth is...”

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT

Jordan and Nick stroll beneath the soaring electric signs.

             JORDAN
      After the honeymoon, I saw them in 
      Santa Barbara. It was touching, 
      actually... 

             JORDAN
      I’d never seen a girl so in love 
      with her husband.  
        (muses cynically)
      A week later, Tom crashed his car. 
      The girl with him was a chambermaid 
      at the Santa Barbara Hotel. It got 
      into all the papers...

As Jordan and Nick approach the curb, waiting for a cab, Nick 
turns to Jordan; he’s struck by a... sudden, puzzled thought.

             NICK
      It’s a strange coincidence, isn’t 
      it? Gatsby’s house being just 
      across the bay...

Jordan whirls round--

             JORDAN
      It’s no coincidence. He bought that 
      house to be near her, he threw all 
      those parties hoping she’d wander 
      in one night. He constantly asked 
      about Daisy... I was the first one 
      who knew her.

Nick takes this in; as if seeing Gatsby for the first time.

             NICK
      All that for a girl he hasn’t seen 
      in five years...? And now he just 
      wants me to have her for tea...?
        (to himself)
      The modesty of it.

             JORDAN
      Kind of takes your breath away, 
      doesn’t it?

A cab pulls up, and Nick opens the door...

INT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS

Jordan slides in...

             TAXI DRIVER
      Evening sweethearts! Where to?

             JORDAN
      Long Island, please.


             NICK
      And you think I should? I mean, 
      does Daisy want to see Gatsby?

             JORDAN
        (a stern whisper)
      She’s absolutely not to know. You 
      are just supposed to invite her 
      over so he can “happen to drop by.”

CLOSE ON: Nick, unsure...

             NICK 
      I remember feeling torn. Was it 
      right to bring my cousin Daisy, a 
      married woman, together with a man 
      I hardly knew? 

As Nick wonders, the taxi floats across Times Square, under 
the cool eyes of the man in the Arrow shirt...

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. DIRT TRACK TO NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

Nick’s taxi pulls past Gatsby’s mansion, ablaze with light.  

             NICK 
      When I returned home, Gatsby’s was 
      lit, from tower to cellar, as if 
      for another wild party. But... 
      There wasn’t a sound.

EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - NIGHT

As Nick’s taxi groans away, Gatsby appears striding through 
the illuminated trees toward Nick. 

             NICK
      Your place looks like the World’s 
      Fair... or Coney Island!

             GATSBY
        (terribly anxious)
      Ah, does it? I’ve... I’ve just been 
      glancing into some rooms... Let’s 
      go to Coney Island, old sport, we 
      can take my car--

             NICK
      It’s too late tonight.

             GATSBY
      Or we can take a plunge in the 
      swimming pool? I haven’t made use 
      of it all summer...

             NICK
      I must go to bed...

Gatsby looks crestfallen. Nick puts him out of his misery.

             NICK 
      Happy to do it. Jay-- I'm going to 
      call Daisy and invite her to tea.

             GATSBY
      Oh, that’s alright. I don’t want to 
      put you to any trouble...

             NICK
      What day would suit you?

             GATSBY
      What day would suit you...? I don’t 
      want to put you to any trouble...

             NICK
      Day after tomorrow alright?

             GATSBY
      Day after tomorrow? Well, I’d... 
      I’d want to get the grass cut.

They both look at the grass - there is a sharp line where 
Nick’s ragged lawn ends and Gatsby’s manicured one begins.

             GATSBY 
      There’s another little thing... I 
      thought-- Look here, old sport-- 
      You don't make much money, do you?

             NICK
      Not really.

             GATSBY
      If you’ll pardon my... You see, I 
      carry on a little business on the 
      side - a sort of sideline - you 
      understand what I’m saying right? 
      You’re selling bonds, aren’t you, 
      old sport?

             NICK
      Trying to.

             GATSBY
      Well, this might interest you... It 
      happens to be a rather confidential 
      sort of thing... But you might pick 
      up a nice bit of money.

             NICK
      I've got my hands full. 

Gatsby’s face falls.

             GATSBY
      You wouldn't have to do any 
      business with Wolfsheim. I assure 
      you.

             NICK
      No, no, no... Its a favor Jay. Just 
      a favor. 

Nick’s sincerity disarms Gatsby; a tiny, embarrassed nod. 

             NICK 
      Happy to do it.


             GATSBY
      A favor?

             NICK
      Yes.

As if no one has ever done him a favor before in his life...

             GATSBY
      Ah, right, right... Goodnight.

             NICK
      Goodnight.

With this, Gatsby turns and strolls back toward his blazing

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - FRONT LAWN - THE FOLLOWING DAY

Heavy rain now falls. 

Gatsby, dressed in white flannel suit, silver shirt, and gold 
tie, leads a dozen umbrella-holding servants across the lawn. 
Herzog holds an umbrella over Gatsby; the other servants 
shelter extravagant floral arrangements in crystal vases...  

Nick watches the parade through his window, opening his door 
just as Gatsby arrives; the servants continue inside.

On the porch, Gatsby looks around distractedly.

             GATSBY
      One of the papers said they thought 
      the rain would stop about four. I 
      think it was the Journal... 

An awkward beat.

             NICK
      The grass looks fine.

             GATSBY
      Grass? 

Gatsby looks at Nick without really comprehending, or seeing.

             GATSBY 
      What Grass? 

SUDDEN CUT TO:

INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY

TIGHT ON: A mantelpiece clock, ticking in the tense silence.

WIDER: The room is crowded with absurdly extravagant floral 
arrangements. Nick sits watching as Gatsby intensely paces. 
The silence stretches, and stretches... Finally...

             GATSBY
      Have you got everything you need?

             NICK
      Perhaps more flowers?

             GATSBY
      I think they did a fine job, don’t 
      you?

             NICK
      Beautiful.

             GATSBY
      You think it’s too much?

             NICK
      I think it’s what you want.

             GATSBY
      I think so too... She’ll be 
      impressed, won’t she old sport?

             NICK
      I am.

With this, Gatsby straightens his suit, sits, and hurriedly 
checks his watch. Another long silence...

PUSH IN ON: Gatsby... SUDDENLY! He leaps to his feet!

             GATSBY
      I can’t wait all day. I’m leaving!

             NICK
      Don’t be silly. It’s just two 
      minutes to four...

But Gatsby heads for the door...

             GATSBY
      Nobody’s coming to tea. It’s too 
      late!

BEEEEEP! Gatsby glimpses Daisy’s Rolls Royce arriving out 
front, and turns to Nick, flushed with fresh panic.

             NICK
      It’s her.

PUSH IN ON GATSBY: Mind racing...

EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - DAY

Daisy’s chauffeur-driven Rolls pulls up in the muddy drive. 

As Nick assists Daisy from the car...

             DAISY
      Is this absolutely where you live, 
      my dearest one?

She looks at him with a mysterious smile.

             DAISY 
      Why did I have to come alone? Are 
      you in love with me?

             NICK
      That’s the secret of Carraway 
      Castle. 
        (playing along)
      Tell your chauffeur to go far away.

             DAISY
      Come back in an hour, Ferdie!
        (grave murmur)
      His name is Ferdie.

INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - HALL - DAY

Daisy continues ahead into the living room. 

Nick hangs back and listens hopefully to Daisy’s reaction at 
discovering Gatsby. He smiles as he hears a delighted...

             DAISY 
      Oh--! Oh, my goodness. I... I can’t 
      believe it. You-- Did you ransack a 
      greenhouse?

INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

             DAISY
        (to herself)
      He is in love with me...

Nick enters, but is shocked to discover that Gatsby is not 
there. Daisy’s merely been admiring the flower display...

             NICK
      That’s funny.

             DAISY
      What’s funny?

KNOCK. KNOCK. Someone is at the door.

             NICK
      One moment...

INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - HALL - CONTINUOUS

Nick opens the door. 


Gatsby, pale as death and soaked, glares miserably at Nick.

             NICK
      What are you doing?

Without a word, Gatsby stalks past him, into...

INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Daisy, her back to the door, is still marvelling at the 
flowers. Then she turns. Sees Gatsby. A sharp intake of 
breath...

The reunited lovers stand, staring at each other for a long, 
surreal, moment of disbelief. Gatsby, eyes locked to Daisy’s, 
is drowning in emotion. Daisy finally manages an artificial, 
choking murmur.

             DAISY
      I’m certainly glad to see you 
      again.

Gatsby’s face is flushed; the veins stand out on his neck as 
his lips spasm in a hopeless attempt to speak. 

Finally, he finds words...

             GATSBY
      I’m... certainly glad to see you as 
      well.

Their hearts pound - the tension excruciating.

EEEEKKK! The scream of a boiling kettle OFF SCREEN breaks the 
tension--

CUT TO:

INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Gatsby reclines uncomfortably against the mantelpiece. His 
elbow rests near the mantelpiece CLOCK. Daisy sits opposite; 
frozen on the edge of a chair. 

The rattle of the tea tray as Nick enters only contributes to 
the already unbearable tension. Gatsby manages to murmur.

             GATSBY
      We've met before...

SUDDENLY the CLOCK tilts at the pressure of Gatsby’s elbow...

And falls! And breaks!

             GATSBY 
      Ah... sorry...

He clumsily tries to repair the clock; but drops it again!

             NICK
        (idiotically)
      It's an old... clock.

             DAISY
        (desperate for small talk)
      Lovely though. A lovely... clock.

Gatsby finally manages to set the clock back on the mantle.

Gatsby takes a seat. 

A long silent beat.

             DAISY 
      We haven't met for many years.

             GATSBY
        (an automatic reflex)
      Five years next November.

The precision of Gatsby's answer is acutely embarrassing. 

             NICK
        (abruptly)
      Tea?

             GATSBY
        (dying)
      Thank you old sport.

             DAISY
        (also mortified)
      Darling thank you.

Nick pours; and they all sit stiffly, sipping their tea. 

A long, terrible silence... 

Suddenly Nick stands.

             NICK
      I just need to... pop into town. 

             GATSBY
        (horrified)
      Town...?

             NICK
      The village; I'll be right back.

As Nick leaves, Gatsby follows.

             GATSBY
      I've got to speak to you...!

INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Wildly following Nick, Gatsby whispers miserably:

             GATSBY
      Oh, God! This is a mistake, a 
      terrible, terrible mistake...

             NICK
      You're just embarrassed, that's 
      all... Daisy's embarrassed too.

             GATSBY
      She's embarrassed?

             NICK
      Just as much as you are.

             GATSBY
      Don't talk so loud!

             NICK
      You're acting like a little boy! 
      You're rude. Daisy's in there all 
      alone and...

Gatsby raises his hand, looks at Nick reproachfully, and 
heads back into the living room.

EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - CONTINUOUS

Nick runs for a TREE whose leaves shield against the rain.

             NICK 
      Looking over my story so far, I’m 
      reminded that for the second time 
      that summer...

WIDE: Nick beneath the tree looks tiny, and very alone. 

             NICK 
      I was guarding other people’s 
      secrets.

INT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - LIVING ROOM - DAY

LATER. Nick re-enters, bedraggled, rain-soaked.

             NICK 
      Once again I was within... 

He tries to get Gatsby and Daisy’s attention, to no avail... 
The lovers are completely and totally absorbed in each other.

             NICK 
      And without...

Nick bangs pots in the sink - still nothing.

He clears his throat:

             NICK
      Its... stopped raining.

Daisy turns; a radiant smile. Every vestige of embarrassment 
between Daisy and Gatsby is gone. Gatsby literally glows. 

             GATSBY
      Yes, it has... 
        (to Daisy)
      Hasn’t it?

He stands, walks to the window and looks out across the bay.

             GATSBY 
      What do you think of that, Daisy? 
      Come look.

Daisy joins Gatsby and they step out onto the porch together.

EXT. NICK’S BUNGALOW - PORCH - CONTINUOUS

             DAISY
      Look. Its my house. Just there 
      across the bay...

Gatsby and Daisy’s eyes meet.

             GATSBY
      I know. I have the same view from 
      my place.

             DAISY
      Where’s your place?

Gatsby turns back to Nick.


             GATSBY
      Nick, I want you and Daisy both to 
      see my house. I’d like to show her 
      around.

             NICK
      Are you sure you want me to come?

             GATSBY
      Absolutely, old sport. Absolutely. 

EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - FRONT GATES - DAY

Servants swing open ivy-covered gates... 

             GATSBY
        (proudly)
      I had the gates brought in from a 
      castle in Normandy.

REVEAL: Gatsby’s castle glistening in the sunlight. 

CLOSE ON: Daisy. A delighted cry.

             DAISY
      Oh, Jay...!? Its so grand!

             GATSBY
      Do you like it?

             DAISY
      I love it...! But how do you live 
      here all alone?

             GATSBY
      I don’t. I keep it always full of 
      interesting, celebrated people...

As Daisy runs ahead, Gatsby murmurs to Nick.

             GATSBY 
      My house looks well doesn’t it? See 
      how the whole front catches the 
      light like that?

Daisy yells back...

             DAUSY
      Come on you two! I want the royal 
      tour!

DISSOLVE TO:


EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GARDENS - DAY

Gatsby has transformed into a good-natured show-off, hurrying 
Nick and Daisy through a maze of fantastical gardens, past 
magnificent fountains and into his castle...

INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - KITCHEN - DAY

Gatbsy shows off his brand new orange-juicer.

             GATBSY
      You must understand, I like all 
      things that are modern.

Daisy readies a cocktail shaker beneath the spout of the 
giant silver orange juice machine.

             GATSBY
      If you press this button here, the 
      oranges shoot through here, are 
      crushed there... The juice of 200 
      oranges extracted in one hour...!

Gatsby presses, the machine groans and juice splashes out!

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. GATSBY’S BEACH - DIVING PONTOON - LATE AFTERNOON

Daisy, Nick and Gatsby drunkenly drive golf balls out toward 
the bay. Nick films on the world’s first home-camcorder...

             GATSBY
      Its a remarkable little camera-- 
      latest design.

While, nearby, a butler in a boat stands watch over a 
spinning gramophone and bottles of champagne...

             DAISY
      You do know, I’m a champion golfer, 
      don’t you? Here, I’ll show you how 
      its done.

CRACK! Daisy cuts a marvelous swing, snapping a club in two!

She falls into Gatsby arms...

Nick films...

             GATSBY
      She looks like she could be on the 
      cover of Vogue, don’t you think...?


DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - EARLY EVENING

Gatsby and Nick trail behind Daisy, crossing the ballroom. 

Daisy, champagne in hand, spots the soaring ballroom organ. 

             DAISY
      Oh...! Its beautiful.

             GATSBY
      Its a custom Wurlitzer.

             DAISY
      Can anyone play it?

             GATSBY
      Klipspringer can. 
        (to his footmen)
      Someone wake Ewing!

Daisy twirls round, overjoyed...

             DAISY
      Music! And we can dance all night!

             GATSBY
      Ewing’s a symphonic genius, he can 
      play anything...!

Daisy runs up the stairs and calls down...

             DAISY
      Then I demand a Charleston!

Gatsby gazes up after Daisy, and confides in Nick...

             GATSBY
        (as if in a dream)
      She makes it look so splendid, 
      don’t you think old sport? 

INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE. GATSBY’S BEDROOM - EVENING

Nick and Daisy follow Gatsby into the bedroom... 

DISSOLVE TO:


Gatsby bounds ahead, starting up a spiral stair... He throws 
open a massive cabinet, revealing a prism of suits, dressing-
gowns, watches and ties.

             GATSBY
      I've got a man in England who buys 
      me clothes...!

He playfully tosses Daisy a boater-hat...

             GATSBY 
      Something for the lady...

Then he begins yanking down shirts and tossing them over the 
rail to Daisy...

             DAISY
      I’ve never seen anything like it!

             GATSBY
      He sends over a selection at the 
      beginning of each season... 

             DAISY
      Jay!

With ever-increasing enthusiasm!

             GATSBY
      These are silk! Linen! Indian 
      flannel! Egyptian cotton!

Daisy, intoxicated, leaps on the bed, arms outstretched...

             DAISY
      No, Jay... you’ll ruin them!
        (to Nick)
      Nicky! He’s a madman!

More and more and more shirts float down...

The rumble of distant thunder. 

CLOSE ON: Daisy. TIME SLOWS AS shirts flutter, like giant 
snowflakes, down toward her. Slowly, quietly, her mirth 
transforms to sobs... She hides her face in shirts... 

Gatsby eases down the stairs and nestles beside Daisy, taking 
her tear-streaked face in his hands...

             GATSBY
      What is it?


             DAISY
      It’s just... It makes me sad, 
      because...

Daisy glances in Nick’s direction...

             GATSBY
      Why?

             DAISY
      ...because...

A suspended moment; Daisy is incapable of speaking her heart.

             NICK 
      Five lost years struggled on 
      Daisy’s lips. But all she could 
      manage was...

             DAISY
      It’s just... Because I've never 
      seen such beautiful shirts before.

             GATSBY
      If it wasn't for the mist we could 
      see the green light... 

             DAISY
      What green light?

             GATSBY
      The one that burns all night at the 
      end of your dock.

As Gatsby and Daisy stare out across the bay...

             NICK 
      Possibly, it had occurred to Gatsby 
      that the colossal significance of 
      that light had vanished forever. 
      Now, it was once again just a green 
      light on a dock. His count of 
      enchanted objects had diminished by 
      one.

Nick, impelled to remind Daisy and Gatsby of his presence, 
emerges from the shadows and descends the spiral staircase. 

He holds a photo of an elderly man in yachting costume...

             NICK
      Who's this? Your father?


             GATSBY
      No, no.. That’s Mr. Dan Cody, old 
      sport... He's dead now. He used to 
      be my best friend years ago.

Daisy joins Nick at the bottom of the steps. In the photo 
with Cody, also in yachting costume, is a young Gatsby...

             DAISY
        (teases)
      You never told me you had a 
      pompadour... or a yacht.

Gatsby hastily plucks a scrapbook from a row on his desk...

             GATSBY
      I want to show you something... 
      Look, here's a lot of clippings, 
      about you.

They admire a scrapbook together.

             DAISY
        (touched)
      You saved my letters...

             GATSBY
      This was my first photo of you.

As Daisy flips through and pulls out an old letter of hers, 
we hear her reading the letter in abstract VOICEOVER:

             DAISY 
      We cant lose each other and let all 
      this glorious love end in nothing. 
      Come home, I’ll be here waiting and 
      hoping, for every long dream of you 
      to come true... Come home Jay...

BBBRRRNNNGGG! The phone shrills. 

             GATSBY
      Excuse me.

Gatsby crosses the room, snatches up the receiver, and turns 
away... He lowers his voice.

             GATSBY 
      Well I can't talk now old sport...

As the timbre of Gatsby’s voice darkens we PUSH CLOSER.

             GATSBY
       I said a small town.



ECU: Gatsby’s eyes narrow.

             GATSBY
      He must know what a small town is.

BOOOOMMM! A storming wind bangs open the French windows! 

As Nick moves to shut them, he glimpses Gatsby...

             GATSBY
        (frightening)
      Well, he's no use to us if Detroit 
      is his idea of a small town...

Gatsby rings off abruptly, and catches Nick’s eye - a tense 
moment - which Gatsby banishes with that electrifying smile. 

We hear the distant, jaunty sounds of a pipe organ...

             GATSBY 
      Ah, Klipspringer! He must be awake! 
      Shall we?

INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - DUSK BECOMING NIGHT

Daisy, wearing a flowing robe and heels, dances a Charleston 
with Nick. 

An elaborate picnic, complete with candelabras and a mountain 
of cushions, is laid out on the floor. There, Gatsby sits, 
looking on, flush with joy. 

Slowly though, Gatsby’s expression turns introspective. As he 
watches Daisy dance, memories flood back to him...

DISSOLVE TO:

FLASHBACK.

AN ARRAY OF MEMORIES AND IMAGES DISSOLVE ONE INTO THE OTHER: 
Gatsby and Daisy, five years ago, about to kiss; a hand-
written letter; a gathering storm; the green light...

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - GRAND BALLROOM - NIGHT

Hundreds of candles flicker in patterns. As a slow, 
melancholic waltz plays, Gatsby and Daisy dance, 
enraptured...


             DAISY
        (whispers)
      I wish I had done everything on 
      earth with you. All my life. 

Gatsby holds her closer.

             DAISY 
      I wish that it could always be like 
      this...

             GATSBY
      It will be...

Across the room, Nick, exhausted and drunk and unnoticed, 
stands to leave. At the ballroom doors he turns back and 
glimpses Gatsby and Daisy, in a universe all their own...

             NICK 
      If only it had been enough for 
      Gatbsy, just to hold Daisy...

      A lot of these newly rich people

        (snorts)
      Hah! A businessman...

             DAISY
      He owned a lot of drug stores.

Gatsby gracefully introduces Senator Gulick to the group...

             GATSBY
      May I introduce Senator Gulick? 
      This is Mr. Carraway and Mrs. 
      Buchanan...

        (objecting quickly)
      Oh no. Not me.

             SENATOR GULICK
        (shaking hands, nods)
      Always a pleasure to meet a 
      Buchanan.

Gatsby bids the Senator farewell, while Tom glowers to Daisy:

             TOM
      I’d rather not be the polo player.

             DAISY
      Oh Tom... You should be proud of

Gatsby interjects--

             GATSBY
        (to the group)
      May I show you around?

He guides them down the stairs...

             GATSBY 
      You must see the faces of a lot of

             GATSBY
      I believe we’ve met somewhere 
      before, Mr. Buchanan. About a month 
      ago.

             TOM
      That’s right... And you were with

As the number subsides, and the crowd applauds, Herzog 
appears and addresses Gatsby with whispered intensity.

             HERZOG
      Mr. Gatsby sir. Mr. Slagle is 
      here...

Herzog indicates SLAGLE, a dark-suited man who stands on the 
distant terrace with three sinister-looking 'associates'. 

Gatsby, so besotted with Daisy that he cannot take his eyes 
off her, whispers fiercely...

             GATSBY
      Not now.

Herzog silently recedes...

Gatsby turns to Tom, and gestures to Daisy...

             GATSBY
      Mr. Buchanan, would you mind, 
      terribly?

Tom does indeed look like he minds, but a group of scantily 
clad girls who cavort gracelessly on the other side of the 
garden momentarily catch his eye.

             TOM
      Of course not; I think I can keep 
      myself amused.

As Daisy takes Gatsby’s arm, she tucks a slim gold pencil 
into Tom’s breast pocket and murmurs...

      No... You see you were there all

      decision... Of course, if anything 
      is not to your liking, we can

He notices Marlene Moon seductively, secretly watching him...

Daisy runs ahead, playfully hurrying past the low-hanging 
branches of the massive tree. She disappears inside...

Gatsby turns, and Daisy’s lips suddenly find his.

Nick, an overwhelming sense of guilt, indicates vaguely in 
the direction of the tree.

Gatsby, frustrated, is about to speak... 

But Nick suddenly appears out of the shadows...

Gatsby and Daisy break off, startled...

      Well, its Tom. He’s wandering

Daisy flashes Gatsby an over-the-shoulder glance; when, 
suddenly, Herzog appears and murmurs...

      Sir; it’s Mr. Slagle; he’s quite... 
      emotional.

A tiny, ruffled, moment; then Gatsby elegantly guides Daisy

through a set of doors, into the conservatory... Gatsby is  
not far behind... A secret rendezvous.

EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT

             GATSBY
      I knew that, that when I kissed 
      this girl, I would... be forever 
      wed to her...

INT. DAISY’S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT

Daisy throws herself in to Gatsby’s arms...

About to kiss, Gatsby is struck by a sudden instinctive 
thought... 

EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT

Gatsby remembers...

             GATSBY
      So I stopped. And I waited... I 
      waited...

INT. DAISY’S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT

Gatsby’s eyes drift up...

             GATSBY (BY THE POOL)
      I waited for a moment longer.

He looks out the dark, crystal windows, beyond the trees... 
to a staircase of moonlight, climbing up, up, up...

             NICK 
      He knew that if he kissed this girl 
      his mind would never again be free 
      to romp like... the mind of God... 
      That falling in love would change 
      his destiny... forever.

EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT

             GATSBY
      And then I just let myself go. 

INT. DAISY’S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT

With sudden resolve Gatsby kisses Daisy... 

In ravenous embrace, they fall onto the long sofa lounge.

             NICK 
      She blossomed for him like a 
      flower...

ECU: Daisy, her lips tremble, eyes wide, breath quickening..

             NICK 
      And the incarnation was complete.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT

The other layers of IMAGERY IN THE CLOUDS MELT AWAY, leaving 
Nick and Gatsby standing by the pool.

             GATSBY
      I knew it was a great mistake for a 
      man like me to fall in love. A 
      great mistake. I’m only 32... I 
      might still be a great man if I 
      could only forget that I once lost 
      Daisy. But my life, old sport, my 
      life has got to be like this...

He draws a slanting line from the lawn to the stars.


             GATSBY 
      It’s got to keep going up.

Gatsby looks to the green light. 

             GATSBY 
      She has to go to Tom and tell him 
      she never loved him... I need to 
      give her more time. I just need to 
      give her more time...

He turns to Nick, reassuring both of them.

             GATSBY 
      Don’t worry old sport, don’t worry. 
      I can protect her here. Good night 
      old sport...

Gatsby heads for his castle, and turns and calls...

             GATSBY 
      You’re wrong about the past, old 
      sport...! 

Gatsby’s POV: The green light across the bay. 

             GATSBY 
      You’re wrong.

The first day of spring; out the window, birds chirp.

Nick is writing and reading aloud... 

             NICK
      There had been music from my 
      neighbor’s all summer. In his blue 
      gardens, men and girls came and 
      went like moths among the 
      whisperings and the laughter and 
      the stars...

He struggles for a more poetic phrasing...

      There were no more parties... 

His lights flicker and go out.

             NICK 
      Gatsby’s lights went out one by 
      one.

At the gates flashbulbs flash! Hordes of press have gathered.

      Daisy visited discreetly. But...

As the gates creak open, Daisy’s limo slides up the drive...

FADE IN NEWSPAPER HEADLINES: “PARTY PALACE GOES DARK!”

             NICK 
      The very same fame that had once 
      been a source of satisfaction to

CLOSE ON: Daisy. She leans to Gatsby and whispers...

      I don’t want to go home. 

Gatsby hold her tighter.

Long shafts of light cut through the high, empty windows... 

WIDE SHOT: An OLD EUROPEAN WOMAN crosses the ballroom, tea 
tray in hand. The room is lined with thuggish, dark-suited 
men. 

We hear a phone conversation between Nick and Gatsby...

             GATSBY 
      I’ve been meaning to call you up. 
      I’m sorry, I’ve been... so busy.

             NICK 
      Is everything alright?

INT. GATSBY’S CASTLE - MAPROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

An unshaven Gatsby in trousers and a black silk robe sits in 
a large arm-chair, under a vast wall of magnificent 
paintings. He hunches over the phone...

             GATSBY 
      Yes... Daisy and I are very much in 
      love.

             NICK 
      I hear you fired all your servants?

             GATSBY 
      Daisy comes over sometimes in the 
      afternoons and I wanted some people 
      who wouldn’t gossip... until we 
      decided what we’re going to do... 
      You see these two towns are pretty 
      close together. And it gets in the 
      papers... You understand?
        (clarifies)
      They’re some people Wolfsheim 
      wanted to do something for. 


Herzog stands in the shadows; and the old European woman 
pours coffee and then recedes...

      But there’s just one thing. She’s

CLOSE ON: Tom lighting a fat Cuban from a chrome lighter.

             TOM
      You know, I read somewhere that the 
      sun's getting hotter every year...

Blue cigar smoke wafts over the clearing of plates...

             TOM 
      Or wait a minute; it's the 
      opposite...

Tom stands and strolls to the open French window... 

             TOM 
      The sun is getting colder every 
      year...

Daisy grips a wine glass in her trembling hand; her eyes are 
terrified, perspiration forms on her upper lip. She glances 
to Gatsby, who stares resolutely from across the table.

CLOSE ON: A perspiring Nick. He glances from Daisy to Gatsby.

The tension is excruciating.

Out the window Tom catches sight of a sailboat across the 
bay.

             TOM 
      How I’d like to be out on that bay 
      today. 

CLOSE ON: Gatsby. He looks up. Beyond the sailboat, he can 
see the outline of his castle. 

             GATSBY
      I’m right across from you. 
        (points)
      Right there.

             TOM
        (unimpressed)
      So you are. 

Gatsby slowly stands and walks behind Daisy.

             GATSBY
      Every night I can see that light at 
      the end of your dock, blinking. 

             TOM
      What light?

Gatsby gently moves his hand over Daisy’s...

             GATSBY
      You see, Mr. Buchanan, I wanted to 
      be close-- Daisy and I--

With sudden intensity Daisy stands!


             DAISY
        (on the verge of tears)
      It's so hot...

Agitated, she sweeps toward the sideboard.

             DAISY 
      Everything's so confused.

She plucks a cigarette from a carved box, and fumbles with 
the paperweight-sized lighter.

             DAISY 
      What'll we do with ourselves this 
      afternoon...? And the day after 
      that...
        (she snaps it again)
      ...and for the next thirty years? 
        (turns suddenly)
      Let’s all go to town! Who wants to 
      go to town?

Her nervous hands drop the lighter, which crashes to the 
mahogany floor. All but Tom recoil in shock. 

             TOM
      Town!? Women... They get these 
      notions...

Gatsby walks to Daisy... As Tom puffs, Gatsby retrieves the 
lighter in one hand, and with his other gently guides Daisy’s 
trembling hand... In that moment, their eyes tenderly meet... 

             GATSBY
        (whispers)
      Daisy... 

             DAISY
        (as if they are alone)
      You look so cool. You always look 
      so cool, like the advertisement of 
      the man... in Times Square...

CLOSE ON: Tom, his jaw tightening. 

             DAISY 
      The man in the cool, beautiful, 
      shirts.

CAMERA FLOATS TOWARD TOM... He violently snuffs his cigar.

      She had told Gatsby that she loved 
      him - and Tom had seen...

SUDDENLY Tom explodes! 


             TOM
      Let’s go to town! I’m perfectly 
      willing...! That’s a marvelous 
      idea! Henri! Have the car brought 
      around immediately!

             DAISY
      Just like that? Can’t anyone at 
      least have a cigarette?

             TOM 
      We’ve smoked all through lunch. 

             DAISY
      Oh, let's have fun. It's too hot to 
      fuss.

             TOM
      It was your great idea Daisy. Why 
      don’t we!? We’ll all go to town!

Daisy doesn’t budge.

             DAISY
      I’ve changed my mind... 
        (teases)
      You brute.

             TOM
        (a dangerous intensity)
      You’ve got me all excited, and now 
      you don’t want to go? We’ll get a 
      great big room at the Plaza, a cold 
      bucket of ice, and some whiskey... 
      It will be fun.

             DAISY
      Fine. Have it your own way, Tom... 
      Come on, Jordan.

As she and Jordan rush past Tom, down the hall, Tom turns 
calmly to Gatsby.

             TOM
      Will you join us, Mr. Gatsby?

Then turns and calls to Henri...

             TOM 
      Henri! Get some whiskey! Two 
      bottles, wrapped in a towel.


CUT TO:

uncomfortably on the drive, waiting for Tom and the women.

BANG! Tom storms out wrapping a quart bottle in a towel.

Daisy and Jordan follow.

             TOM
      Mr. Gatsby! Would you be good 
      enough to take my coupé? And I’ll 
      drive everyone else in your circus 
      wagon.

             GATSBY
      I don’t think there’s much gas, old 
      sport.

Gatsby looks to Daisy, a burning stare.

             TOM
        (looks at the gauge)
      Plenty of gas. And if we run out, 
      then we’ll stop at a drug store.
      I hear you can buy anything at a 
      drug store nowadays...
        (savagely eyes Gatsby)
      Isn’t that right, Mr. Gatsby?

A moment of sharp tension; Daisy wrenches from Tom’s arm.

             DAISY
      You take Nick and Jordan, Tom!

She slips quickly into the coupé... 

             DAISY 
      We’ll meet you at the Plaza! I’ll 
      be the man on the corner smoking 
      two cigarettes...

Gatsby’s and Tom’s eyes flash; a harsh, competitive glance.

Tom lunges into the Duesenberg, slams the gears and lurches 
away, leaving Gatsby, Daisy, and the coupé in the dust.

      you? But I have a-- an almost 
      second sight, sometimes, that tells 
      me what to do. And I’ve made a 
      small investigation of this fellow. 

             JORDAN
        (condescending)
      And you found he was an Oxford man?

             TOM

EXT. THE VALLEY OF ASHES - WILSON’S GARAGE - DAY

SCRREEECH! Tom slams the breaks and the Duesenberg slides to 
a stop at Wilson’s...

Wilson doesn’t budge. He’s staring with sickly eyes at the 
giant billboard of Dr. T. J. Eckleberg.

             TOM
      Wilson! Wilson! What are you 
      waiting for!? Let’s have some 
      gas...
        (gets out)
      Do I have to do it myself?

             WILSON 
      I’m sick. I’m all run down. I need 
      money bad... My wife and I want to 
      go West.

             TOM
      Your wife does...?

Tom glances up to the window above the garage. Myrtle’s face, 
badly bruised, stares back. Tom clocks this, and hesitates...

             NICK 
      Tom was feeling the hot whips of 
      panic. His mistress and wife, an 
      hour ago so secure, were both 
      slipping from his control...

             WILSON
      I just got wised-up to something 
      funny the last two days. She's 
      goin’ whether she wants to or not. 

Tom isn’t listening... He sees the coupe approaching at high-
speed, threatening to leave him in the dust!

             TOM
      What do I owe you!?

             WILSON
      Dollar twenty.

The blue coupé flashes by. Tom glances back to Myrtle... And 
then jumps into the Duesenberg. 

             TOM
      You can have the car! I'll send it 
      around tomorrow!

He throws coins into the dirt for Wilson to collect. Then he 
floors the gas and peels out after the coupé!

I/E. GATSBY’S CAR/TOM’S COUPÉ - DAY

VRRROOMM! The cars roar neck-and-neck, veering, swerving and 
skidding PERILOUSLY close. 

As Tom and Gatsby shoot dangerous glances at one another, 
Daisy waves carefree back to Tom.... 

PAN UP: The cars tear over the Queensboro Bridge, toward the 
glimmering, golden city...

SLAM CUT TO:

CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! Shards of ice spilt off from a hunk as a 
bell-boy makes ice-cubes...

             TOM 
      That’s enough...

The room is large and stifling hot, it has been filled with 
huge ice buckets in an attempt to cool it. Gatsby, Tom, Nick, 
Daisy and Jordan are bathed in a thin sheen of perspiration.

             DAISY
      Open another window.

             NICK
      There aren't any more.

             DAISY
      Then telephone for an axe...

             TOM
      Forget about the heat. You make it 
      worse by crabbing about it.

             GATSBY
      Why not let her alone, old sport? 

             TOM
      That's a great expression of yours, 
      isn't it?

             GATSBY
      What is?

Tom turns to Gatsby...

             TOM
      'Old sport'. Where'd you pick it 
      up?

             DAISY
      Now see here, Tom; if you're going 
      to make personal remarks I won't 
      stay here one minute. 

Gatsby's foot beats a restless tattoo; Tom eyes him suddenly.

             TOM
      Mr. Gatsby, I understand you're an 
      Oxford man.

             GATSBY
      No, not exactly. 

             TOM
      Oh yes, I understand you went to 
      Oxford.

             GATSBY
      Yes - I went there.

Tom's laugh is incredulous and insulting.

             TOM
      Sure; the man in the pink suit went 
      to Oxford!

             DAISY
      Tom...!

Gatsby stands.

             GATSBY
        (slow, intense)
      I told you I went there.

             TOM
      I heard you, but I'd like to know 
      when.

             GATSBY
      You’d like to know when....? It was 
      in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed 
      five months. That's why I can't 
      exactly call myself an Oxford man.

Tom glances around to see if the others mirror his disbelief. 
But they are all looking at Gatsby.

             GATSBY 
      You see, it was an opportunity they 
      gave to some of the officers who 
      actually fought in the war. 

Nick can’t help but smile.

             NICK 
      I wanted to get up and slap Gatsby 
      on the back.

             DAISY
      I'll make you a drink Tom, then you 
      won't seem so stupid to yourself... 

But Tom’s not done yet.

             TOM
      Wait a minute, I want to ask Mr. 
      Gatsby one more question.

             GATSBY
      Go on. Please Mr. Buchanan, go on.

             TOM
      What kind of a row are you trying 
      to cause in my house anyhow?

They are out in the open at last and Gatsby is content. 

             DAISY
      He isn't causing a row; you're 
      causing a row. Please have a little 
      self-control!

             TOM
      Self-control! I suppose the latest 
      thing is to sit back and let Mr. 
      Nobody from Nowhere make love to 
      your wife? Well, if that's the idea 
      you can count me out... See, 
      nowadays people begin by sneering 
      at family life and family 
      institutions and next you know 
      they'll throw everything overboard 
      and we’ll have intermarriage 
      between black and white!

             JORDAN
      We’re all white here, Tom.

             GATSBY
      Your wife doesn't love you. She's 
      never loved you. She loves me!

             TOM
      You must be crazy.

             GATSBY
      No, old sport. See, she never loved 
      you... She only married you because 
      I was poor and she was tired of 
      waiting. It was a terrible, 
      terrible mistake, but in her heart 
      she never loved anyone but me!

             JORDAN
      We should go...

             GATSBY
      Daisy and I have nothing to hide...

             DAISY
      Jay let’s go, please...!

             TOM
      Sit down Daisy!

             GATSBY
        (reassuring)
      Yes, Daisy, please sit down.

Tom's voice gropes unsuccessfully for the paternal note.

             TOM
      What's been going on? I want to 
      hear all about it.

             GATSBY
      I just told you what's been going 
      on; its been going on for five 
      years...!

Tom turns to Daisy sharply.

             TOM
      You've been seeing him for five 
      years?

             GATSBY
      Not seeing. No, we couldn't; but 
      both of us loved each other all 
      that time, old sport, and you 
      didn't know. I used to laugh 
      sometimes, to think that you didn't 
      know...

             TOM
      Oh - that's all; you're crazy! I 
      can't speak about what happened 
      five years ago, because I didn't 
      know Daisy then - but I'll be 
      damned if I see how you got within 
      a mile of her unless you brought 
      the groceries to the back door. But 
      all the rest of that's a god-damned 
      lie. Daisy loved me when she 
      married me and she loves me now.

Tom starts to make himself a drink...

             GATSBY
      No...



             TOM
      She does, though... And what's 
      more, I love Daisy too. Once in a 
      while I go off on a spree, but I 
      always come back, and in my heart I 
      love her all the time...

             DAISY
      You’re revolting...

Daisy’s voice drops an octave lower, filling the room with 
thrilling scorn... 

             DAISY 
      Do you know why we left Chicago...? 
      I'm surprised they didn't treat you 
      to the story of that little spree.

Gatsby walks over and stands beside Daisy.

             GATSBY
      That's all over now. Just tell him 
      the truth, that you never loved 
      him; and all this... all this pain 
      will be wiped out forever.

Daisy looks at Gatsby blindly.

             DAISY
      Why, how could I love him, 
      possibly?

             GATSBY
      You never loved him.

Daisy hesitates; too late, she realizes what she is doing.

             DAISY
      I never loved him.

             GATSBY
      That’s right...

             TOM
      Not at Kapiolani?

             DAISY
      No.

             TOM
        (a husky tenderness)
      Not that day I carried you down 
      from the Punch Bowl to keep your 
      shoes dry...? Daisy? Never?



             DAISY
      Please don’t.

             TOM
      Daisy...

Her voice is cold, but the anger is gone.

             DAISY
      There, Jay.

She trembles as she looks to Gatsby...

             DAISY 
      You want too much! I love you now; 
      isn't that enough? I can't help 
      what's past.
        (begins to sob)
      I did love him once; but I loved 
      you too.

             GATSBY
        (shocked, uncomprehending)
      You loved me too?

             TOM
        (savage)
      Even that's a lie. She didn't know 
      you were alive. There are things 
      between Daisy and me that you'll 
      never know, things that neither of 
      us can ever forget.

The words seem to bite physically into Gatsby.

             GATSBY
      I want to speak to Daisy alone. 
      She's all excited now... 

             DAISY
      Even alone I can't say I never 
      loved Tom. It wouldn't be true.

             TOM
      Of course it wouldn't.

Daisy turns to her husband.

             DAISY
      As if it mattered to you.


             TOM
      Of course it matters. I'm going to 
      take better care of you from now 
      on.

             GATSBY
      You're not taking care of her any 
      more! Daisy's leaving you.

             TOM
      Nonsense.

             DAISY
        (with visible effort)
      I am, though.

             TOM
      She's not leaving me; and certainly 
      not for a common swindler!

Tom's words suddenly lean down over Gatsby.

             TOM 
      Mr. Gatsby, who exactly are you 
      anyhow? You see, I have made a 
      small investigation into your 
      affairs... You're one of Meyer 
      Wolfsheim’s bunch. 

Tom turns to the others and speaks rapidly.

             TOM 
      See, he and this Wolfsheim bought 
      up a lot of 'drug stores' and sold 
      bootlegged alcohol over the 
      counter!

             GATSBY 
      What about it, old sport?

             TOM
      Don’t call me ‘old sport!’ This 
      drug store business is just small 
      change compared to the bonds stunt 
      you and Wolfsheim have got going on 
      now.

             GATSBY
      Well your friend Walter Chase isn’t 
      too proud to come in on it.

             TOM
      I’ve been giving that some thought. 
      How does a reputable banker like 
      Walter Chase find himself up to his 
      eyeballs in debt to a little kike 
      like Wolfsheim?

             GATSBY
      It’s called ‘greed,’ old sport.

             TOM
      That’s right; you’ve got half of 
      Wall Street out there swilling your 
      free booze at that fun park every 
      weekend...
        (to Nick)
      I’m surprised he hasn’t tried to 
      drag you in...

Nick looks away sharply. Tom registers this. 

             TOM 
      My God, he has...

             GATSBY
      He’s got nothing to do with--

             TOM
      With your little racket...
        (to Daisy)
      Daisy... Can’t you see who this guy 
      is? With his house and his parties 
      and his fancy clothes; he’s just a 
      front for Wolfsheim, a gangster, to 
      get his claws into respectable folk 
      like Walter...! 

             GATSBY
        (a vicious sneer)
      The only respectable thing about 
      you, old sport, is your money, 
      that’s it, and now I’ve just as 
      much as you; so that means we’re 
      equal!!

Tom smiles with smug, condescending scorn.

             TOM
      Oh no, no, we’re different; I am, 
        (gesturing at Nick and 
         Jordan)
      They are...
        (now at Daisy)
      She is; 


             TOM
      we’re all different from you - we 
      were born different, it’s in our 
      blood, and nothing you do, or say, 
      or steal or dream up, can ever 
      change that... And a girl like 
      Daisy will never...!

Gatsby explodes with terrifying rage.

             GATSBY
      SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUTTT UP!!!!

Shock jolts the room. We float toward Gatsby. His rage-filled 
eyes stare into the void, as, with all his willpower, he 
restrains himself from ripping Tom apart...

             NICK
      Gatsby looked, in that moment... as 
      if he had “killed a man.”

Tom snorts a dismissive laugh. 

             TOM
      That’s right Mr. Gatsby, show us 
      those fine Oxford manners...

Gatsby recovers and turns to Diasy, who is trembling in the 
corner, on the verge of tears.

             DAISY 
      My sincerest apologies. I... I seem 
      to have lost my temper. 

Struggling for self control, Gatsby turns toward her as if 
Tom suddenly no longer exists.

             GATSBY
      Daisy darling... None of this has 
      any consequence. Don’t listen to 
      him Daisy.

Daisy blanches; Gatsby, now desperate, babbles incoherently.

             GATSBY 
      We’re going back to Louisville to 
      be married. Then we’re going to 
      live together in our house; it’s--

There is a feeling of excruciating unease in the room.

CLOSE ON: Nick.


             NICK 
      He began talking excitedly, denying 
      everything... But with every word 
      Daisy was drawing further and 
      further into herself, until only 
      the dead dream fought on...

             DAISY
      Please Tom; I can't stand this 
      anymore!

Daisy is staring, terrified, courage gone; she looks to Tom.

             TOM
      You two start on home... 
        (to Gatsby)
      In Mr. Gatsby's car.

Daisy is alarmed now.

             TOM 
      Go on. He won't annoy you. I think 
      he realizes that his little 
      flirtation... is over.

Daisy, hysterical, runs from the room; Gatsby pursues her.

             GATSBY
      Daisy...!

Daisy and Gatsby are gone. A terrible silence fills the room. 
Tom begins wrapping the unopened whiskey bottle in the towel.

             TOM
      Want any of this? Jordan? Nick? 
      Nick?
      

             NICK
      What?

             TOM
	Want any?
     
	        NICK
      No... I just remembered - today's 
      my birthday. I’m thirty.

Tom mutters as he pours himself a drink...

             TOM
      Happy birthday...

Nick is staring out the window, lost in thought... 



             NICK 
      Thirty - the promise of a decade of 
      loneliness...

NICK’S POV: To the setting sun and the Queensboro Bridge...

             NICK 
      The formidable stroke of thirty 
      died away, as Gatsby and Daisy 
      drove on through the cooling 
      twilight, towards death...

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. WILSON’S BEDROOM - TWILIGHT

MYRTLE FLIES PAST CAMERA as Wilson drags her across the room!

             WILSON
      God knows everything you've been 
      doing!

Grabbing his wife’s hair he presses her face to the window.

             WILSON 
      You might fool me but you can't 
      fool God! 

OVER WILSON’S SHOULDER, we see with shock, that he is looking 
at the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleberg.

             WILSON
      God sees everything!

Below the Eckleberg sign a train thunders through the level 
crossing. 

The final carriage clears to reveal Gatsby’s yellow car 
waiting on the other side of the crossing.

CLOSE ON: Myrtle seeing the yellow car; a desperate whisper.

             MYRTLE
        (thinking its Tom)
      He’s here...

WHACK! Myrtle gives a sudden backhand to Wilson’s face as she 
twists from his grasp! 

CUT TO:


EXT. WILSON’S GARAGE - TWILIGHT

Standing outside his restaurant, the owner, MICHAELIS sees 
Myrtle rush out of the garage shouting hysterically. 

             MYRTLE
      Stop, Tom, please, stop!

I/E. GATSBY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

SUDDENLY! Myrtle appears in the headlights of Gatsby’s car...

ECU: The sleeve of the pink suit and the 'Daisy' signet ring, 
as Gatsby’s hand on the wheel tries to veer away...!

             GATSBY
      No...!

BUT the car STRIKES Myrtle!

SLOW MOTION, TERRIBLE, NIGHTMARISH, EXPRESSIONISTIC IMAGES: 
Glass shattering, blood splattering, Daisy screaming, 
Myrtle’s body flying through the air, her pearls showering 
the night like a thousand new stars...

THUMP. Her torn open body hits the ground.

CLOSE ON: The giant billboard, the towering eyes of Dr. T.J. 
Eckleberg, watching everything...

DISSOLVE THROUGH THE WHITES OF THE EYES TO:

INT. TOM’S COUPÉ - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: The coupe’s blinding headlights.

As the coupé nears, Nick, Tom and Jordan see the commotion.

             TOM
      Wreck...! Good. Wilson will have a 
      little business at last... Let’s 
      take a look..

             JORDAN
      Must we?

             TOM
      Just a look.


INT. WILSON’S GARAGE - NIGHT

The dim garage is lit only by a swinging yellow globe.

Wilson stands on the raised threshold of his office, swaying 
and wailing a high, horrible call.

             WILSON
      O, my Ga-od! O, my Ga-od! 

A crush of gawking spectators speak in hushed tones.

CUT TO: Tom pushing through the crowd. 

CLOSE ON: He stops, and makes a harsh sound...

MYRTLE’S BODY, wrapped in a blanket, lies on a work table. 

Tom bends over it, shocked, motionless. 

CUT TO: Nick, watching Tom’s reaction.

A POLICEMAN stands next to Tom taking down names.

             POLICEMAN
        (to Tom)
      Sir. Sir, I’m gonna have to ask you 
      to step away--

             TOM
      Get off me...!
        (regains his composure)
      I’m fine. I’m fine.

             POLICEMAN
      You knew her?

             TOM
        (a long pause)
      No... Not really...

             POLICEMAN
      Well then I have to ask you to step 
      back.

             TOM
      What happened...?

             POLICEMAN
      She ran out ‘inna road. Son-of-a-
      bitch didn't even stopus car.

A well-dressed African American man steps near.


             WELL-DRESSED MAN
      I saw it! It was a yellow car; big 
      yellow car.

CUT TO: Tom; a slow realization.

PUSH IN: On Nick; a disbelieving horror.

The Greek restaurant owner MICHAELIS pipes up.

             MICHAELIS
      Yeah, a big yellow duezy; custom 
      job.

Some of this conversation has reached Wilson; suddenly 
sighting Tom, he moves toward him with a cry...

             WILSON
      You don't have to tell me what kind 
      of car it was! I know what kind of 
      car it was!

Tom, realizing the danger, moves quickly and seizes Wilson.

             TOM
        (a soothing gruffness)
      Pull yourself together...

Wilson, distraught, almost collapses, but Tom holds him 
upright and pushes him into: 

INT. WILSON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

Tom sets Wilson down and whispers intensely. 

             TOM
      Listen, I just got here from New 
      York. I was bringing you the coupé. 
      That yellow car wasn't mine, do you 
      hear? I haven't seen it all 
      afternoon.

The policeman follows and turns suspiciously to Tom.

             POLICEMAN
      What color's your car?

             TOM
      Blue, a coupé; we've come straight 
      from New York.

             MICHAELIS
      Yeah, they just stopped...

The policeman accepts, suspicious still...

             POLICEMAN
      Alright... Blue.

In the relative calm of the office, Wilson’s clouded, 
desperate eyes look up at Tom.

             WILSON
      Who owns the yella’ car...?

             TOM
        (a tiny pause)
      Fella named Gatsby; he’s a crook, 
      George. Gives those parties the 
      papers are always talking about...

             WILSON
      Maybe he was the one foolin’ with 
      Myrtle; maybe that’s why he killed 
      her...?

             TOM
      Yeah. Maybe. Guy like that, who 
      knows...

Wilson starts sobbing again.

             WILSON
      Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!

He rests his head on Tom’s shoulder...

Tom consoles Wilson and then whispers...

             TOM
      Gatsby. Something outta be done 
      about a fella like that. He’ll 
      pay... Oh, he’ll pay...

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. TOM’S COUPÉ - NIGHT

CLOSE ON: Tom driving. He sobs...

             TOM
      The goddamn coward didn't even stop 
      his car...

Jordan and Nick sit silently beside Tom; he turns to them, 
triumphantly accusing...

             TOM
      You gonna defend him now, huh? 

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT

The coupe drifts slowly up the drive. 

EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT

As they walk up the stone staircase, Tom disposes of the 
situation in a few brisk phrases.

             TOM
      I'll telephone for a taxi, Nick. 
      Come in and have some supper while 
      you wait... 

Tom opens the door.

             NICK
      No thanks. I'll wait outside.

Tom stares at Nick, absorbing his disdain.

             TOM
      What is the matter with you? 

Tom snorts and goes in; Jordan puts her hand on Nick’s arm.

             JORDAN
      Won't you come in, Nick?

             NICK
      No... thanks.

             JORDAN
      It's only half past nine...

             NICK
      No. I think I’ve had enough... Of 
      everyone.

CLOSE ON: Jordan; she gives Nick a long, hurt look...

But Nick stares decisively back; after a moment he turns 
sharply and walks off. Dejected, Jordan sweeps inside...


EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - NIGHT

As Nick’s feet crunch upon the white gravel of the drive, he 
is startled by a voice from the shadows...

             GATSBY
      Hello old sport...

Cautiously, Nick approaches the hedge. The closer he gets the 
more certain he becomes: Gatsby is hiding, just below Daisy’s 
window. His pace quickens. 

             NICK
      What are you doing!?

             GATSBY
      Just sitting here...

             NICK
      Yes, I can see that.

             GATSBY
      Did you see any trouble out on the 
      road?

             NICK
      Trouble!? That woman you ran down 
      is dead Jay!

             GATSBY
      I thought so... I told Daisy I 
      thoughts so--

             NICK
      Daisy? Do you hear yourself--

             GATSBY
      Its better that the shock should 
      come all at once--

             NICK
      What’s wrong with you!? How could 
      you!?

             GATSBY
      Please... Keep your voice down, old 
      sport.

             NICK
      Tom was right! You’re nothing but a 
      goddamn coward!



             GATSBY

      Keep your voice down... There. Was. 
      No. Point. In. Stopping.

      NO POINT!?

             GATSBY
      It, it killed her instantly. I--

             NICK
      Yes, I was there. I saw! It ripped 
      her open!

Panicked, Gatsby grabs Nick, trying to explain...

             GATSBY
      I understand-- It was... my fault. 
      This woman just rushed out, as if 
      she wanted to speak to us... It all 
      happened so quickly. She-- I... 
      tried-- to turn the wheel.

             NICK
      She?

SUDDENLY! The CREAK of a door opening. A shaft of light...

Henri emerges. 

AN INTERMINABLE moment. Gatsby and Nick hold their breaths. 

Finally, Henri goes back in.

CLOSE ON: Nick, a realization.

             NICK
      It was Daisy?

Finally, and very slowly, Gatsby admits.

             GATSBY
      You see, after we left New York, 
      she was very nervous. She thought 
      driving would steady her. But this 
      woman, she just rushed out at us.

CUT TO: We replay the violent accident, this time fully 
REVEALING that it was Daisy behind the wheel...

             GATSBY
      It all happened so quickly. It 
      wasn’t her fault... 
             

             GATSBY
      It was my fault. I should have 
      taken the wheel... 
        (intense)
      No one must know. Promise me. No 
      one. Promise me. 

             NICK
      Jay-- You shouldn’t be here. You 
      should get out of here.

Gatsby gazes back to the house...

             GATSBY
      No. No. No. I’m going to wait. I’ll 
      wait all night if necessary. You 
      see, Daisy’s locked herself in her 
      room, and she’s going to turn her 
      light off and on again if he tries 
      to bother her about that 
      unpleasantness this afternoon. If 
      he tries ANY brutality whatsoever--

             NICK
      Tom won't touch her. He’s not even 
      thinking about her...

             GATSBY
      Oh, I don't trust him, old sport. I 
      don’t trust him.

Nick considers the light at the end of the terrace.

             NICK
      Alright. Alright... You wait here. 
      I’ll see if there’s any commotion.

             GATSBY
      Would you do that for me? Thank 
      you. Thank you, old sport.

EXT. BUCHANAN MANSION - TERRACE - NIGHT

Nick skirts the terrace...

Rounding the corner, Nick, unseen in the shadows, can see Tom 
and Daisy sitting at one end of the vast dining table, a 
plate of cold chicken and two bottles of ale between them. 

As Tom speaks intently and earnestly at Daisy, his hand falls 
gently upon hers and she nods tiredly in agreement... 

             TOM
      Its going to be all right...



Then, very slowly, Daisy lays her head on Tom’s shoulder.

Exhausted, Gatsby turns...

             GATSBY
      Oh, hello, old sport. Yes, yes, 
      everything’s just fine... About 
      four o'clock she came to the 
      window; she stood there... Then, 
      well, she turned out the light... 
      So...

      Give me a hand will you old sport?

CLOSE ON: Nick.

      Jay... You oughtta go away.

He helps Gatsby cover the car.

             NICK
      Tonight. They’ll trace your car.

             GATSBY
        (as if Nick is crazy)
      Go away? I can’t leave now. Not 
      tonight.


             NICK
      Do you understand that a woman has 
      been killed--?

Nick follows him from the garage toward the house.

             GATSBY
      Daisy’s going to call in the 
      morning. Then we’ll make plans, to 
      go away together.

             NICK
      But Jay she--

Sensing Nick’s tone, Gatsby cuts him off and banishes all 
doubt with intense certainty.

             GATSBY
      She just needs time to think...
        (he continues, calm)
      She’ll call. In the morning. She 
      just needs time to think.

             NICK
      Jay--

             GATSBY
      She just needs to think. She’s 
      going to call in the morning. 

Gatsby smiles that smile of endless possibility...

He turns to go in but stops.

             GATSBY
      Wait up with me? The suns almost 
      up...

      You know, I thought for awhile I 
      had a lot of things... But the 
      truth is... I’m empty. 

             GATSBY
      I suppose that’s why I make things 
      up about myself... But I‘ve wanted 
      to tell you the whole story for a 
      long time... You see. I grew up, 
      terribly, terribly poor, old sport. 
      My folks were, well-- 

As Gatbsy continues, Nick’s V.O. FADES UP:

             NICK 
      He revealed his humble beginnings, 
      his transformative voyage with Dan 
      Cody, the war, Oxford, and how he’d 
      joined Wolfsheim in the business...

In the silvery pre-dawn, Nick and Gatsby trail slowly toward 
the end of the dock.

             NICK 
      It was also that night that I 
      became aware of Gatsby’s... 
      extraordinary gift for hope.

             GATSBY
      ...I can't describe to you how 
      surprised I was to find out that I 
      loved her, old sport. And that she 
      loved me too. 

             NICK 
      A gift that I have never found in 
      any other person...

             GATSBY
      I never realized just how 
      extraordinary a nice girl could be.

             NICK 
      And which it is not likely I shall 
      ever find again.

             GATSBY
      I thought out my life with Daisy in 
      it, trying to figure out how we 
      could marry and struggle along on 
      so many dollars a month...

Finally, Nick is able to ask:


             NICK
      What was in the letter?

Gatsby reaches the end of the wharf and looks to the green 
light across the bay...

             GATSBY
      The truth, the reason why after the 
      war, I hadn’t been able to return--

In the clouds overhead, the IMAGE OF DAISY, in the bathtub 
with the DISSOLVING LETTER... And now, we can see what Gatsby 
wrote in that fateful, last letter: “Daisy, the truth is... 
I’m penniless.”

             GATSBY
      I asked her to wait until I’d made 
      something of myself. But-- She was 
      young, there was so much pressure.

The IMAGE of Daisy fades...

             GATSBY
      You see, I felt married to her... 
      That was all.

             NICK 
      It had all been for her. The house

      A personal call? Of course.

The GARDENER comes to the foot of the steps.

             GARDENER
      I'm going to drain the pool today, 
      Mr. Gatsby.

      Not today. It’s so beautiful.
        (to Nick)
      You know, old sport, I've never 
      used that pool all summer?

Gatsby enthusiastically heads down the stairs...

      behind him...

Nick smiles back.

             NICK
      Gatsby believed in the green light, 
      the orgastic future that year by 
      year, recedes before us...

PUSH PAST GATSBY: Out over the water, toward the green light 
eternally pulsing at the end of Daisy’s dock...

             NICK
      It eluded us then, but that’s no 
      matter - tomorrow we will run 
      faster...

Gatsby reaches out--

             NICK
      Stretch out our arms farther... And 
      one fine morning... 

As we PUSH PAST Gatbsy’s outstretched hand, THE OPENING IMAGE 
RETURNS: The green light pulsing in the abstract dark...

Nick’s final words appear as TYPE ON THE SCREEN.

             NICK
      So we beat on, boats against the 
      current, borne back ceaselessly, 
      into the past.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SANTITARIUM - NICK’S ROOM - SUMMER - DAY

Nick pulls a final page from his typewriter, sets the page on 
top of his completed manuscript and we clearly see the title:

“GATSBY.”

Nick considers this and then handwrites:

“THE GREAT...”

DISSOLVE THROUGH THE FINAL TITLE - “THE GREAT GATSBY” - TO: 
The green light. It pulses one last time... Then, fades to 
BLACK. 

THE END.
