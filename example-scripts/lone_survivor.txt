EXT. BAGRAM AIR BASE, AFGHANISTAN


Through massive sun flare, a BLACKHAWK Chopper coming in 
fast. Landing hard on Bagram Air Base.

             LUTTRELL
        (vo)
      It’s something most of us have 
      known all of our lives. What we all 
      wanted. It’s in our blood. 

A team of medical personal and Navy officers descend on the 
chopper. An assortment of high-ranking GENERALS and 
COMMANDING OFFICERS there to meet the chopper.  Tight shots.  
A bloody hand dangles. A tear filled eyeball, sliced feet.

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
        (vo)
      There’s a storm inside of us. I’ve 
      heard many team guys speak of this. 
      A burning. A river. A drive.


INT. OPERATING ROOM 


Clothes cut.  Blood soaked Dog Tags cut. “Luttrell” in UA 
boxer shorts, IVs and fresh blood bags. Multiple Gunshots. 
Chunk of an ear missing. Heartbeat monitor. Weak pulse.

             LUTTRELL
        (vo)
      An unrelenting desire to push 
      yourself harder and further than 
      anyone could think possible.

Chunks of bullet and shrapnel filling metal bowl. Tears 
streaming down cheeks, a hand scrawled map on a left thigh, 
focused eyes of surgeons. Admirals’ pace in the hallway.

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
        (vo)
      Pushing ourselves into those dark 
      cold corners where the bad things 
      live. Where the bad things fight. 

Heart monitor weak. Getting weaker. Compound fracture left 
shin. Bloody feet rinsed clean. Water flushing out bullet 
holes. Loose cracked tooth pulled out. Heart monitor getting 
weaker.

Surgical pack working franticly to save Luttrell.

Tight on HEART MONITOR: FLATLINE

                                        2.

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
      We wanted that fight at the highest 
      volume. The loud fight. The 
      loudest, coldest, hottest, most 
      unpleasant of the unpleasant 
      fights. 

Pushing in on the flatline. Alarm screaming. Tight on 
Luttrell’s eyes starting to glaze over. Dying.

Luttrell checks his map against his wrist strapped GPS. 
Whistles quietly to himself. 

             LUTTRELL
      I don’t see anything but steep. I 
      could be wrong. Hope I’m wrong. If 
      it’s anything but steep I’m not 
      seeing it. 

             DIETZ
      Just put your feet where I put my 
      feet. All day long. You’re gonna 
      love it. 

SHANE PATTON plugged into an iPod. SLIPKNOT pounding into his 
head. He quietly sings along. 
Kristensen leans over to Axelson, the navigator, adjusts his 
upper right strap on his front pack.

             KRISTENSEN
      I’m real interested in the pitch. 
      If it ain’t fucking glorious, come 
      back, try another route. Don’t 
      waste your time trying to cross 
      something that’s gonna knock the 
      shit out of us.

             AXE
      Roger that.

Kristensen moves over to MIKE MURPHY.

             KRISTENSEN
      She does not need a Arabic horse.

             MURPHY
      How do you know about that?

             KRISTENSEN
      I know everything Murphy.

             MURPHY
      Check.

             KRISTENSEN
      Morab Tennessee Walking Horse cross 
      stallion.

             MURPHY
      What?


             KRISTENSEN
      Original Silver. Lone Ranger’s 
      Horse. 

             MURPHY
      Really?

             KRISTENSEN
      Tennessee cross stallion. That’s a 
      fucking horse.

             MURPHY
      Yes sir.

             KRISTENSEN
      Lone Ranger’s horse of choice.

             MURPHY
      Sounds excellent sir.

             KRISTENSEN
      Glorious horse Murphy.

Tight on Luttrell starring into the plunging sun.


EXT. AFGHAN VILLAGE - DAY

INTERCUT AFGHAN VILLAGE. Intro Afghan warlord. AHMAD SHAH.
35 years old. Tall, strong. Fierce. He moves through an 
Afghan village with a small pack of equally fierce Taliban 
warriors.

                                        4.

LOCAL AFGHANS avoid eye contact. This Shah and crew feels 
like an old school western bad guy moving through a cow town.
NOTHING like the SUICIDE BOMBERS of BAGDAD. These are real 
warriors. Strong-jawed. Thin but ripped muscles. Worn rich 
soulful faces, vivid eyes, color reds and blues. Strong 
boots. Military vests. Good radio equipment. Well-maintained 
weapons.

Shah’s number two is TARAQ. Late twenties. Shah is vicious, 
TARAQ, is more vicious.  Strong and very, very violent.

A very worthy opponent.

RIGHT now they are clearly pissed. Shah leads the way, walks 
with purpose.
They are looking for a man. Someone has violated TALIBAN LAW, 
accused of aiding the Americans.
Shah moves into a house. Women and children terrified. 
Trembling. Women pleading.

	       SHAH
	Where is he?

               SHAH 
        Hagha Cherta Dey? 

The women scream. As Shah starts throwing teenage boys around 
the room. Slamming them viciously into walls. 
A 25-year-old man Gulab tries to reason with Shah.  A YOUNG 
BOY watches. 

	       GULAB
	Please, we want no trouble.

		GULAB 
	Mehrabani/lutfan, monga hes 
        mushkil no ghowaro

Taraq throws Gulab down hard. Turns, locks eyes with an older 
Afghan man     (30s). Taraq moves quickly at him, kicking him in 
the face,      his foot down hard on his throat.

	       SHAH
	Have you spoken with the 
	Americans?

	     AFGHAN MAN
	Please! No!

	        TARAQ
	Gulab watches. Frustrated. Furious.

                SHAH 
        Aya taso Americayano sara 
        khaberi keri dey?  

                AFGHAN MAN 
        Mehrabani/lutfan!  Na!

                 TARAQ 
	You lie!

		 AFGHAN MAN
	Ta Dorogh wayee!
	Please!

		 AFGHAN MAN
	Mehrabani/lutfan!

                                        5.

He’s pressing down hard. Choking the man. The man’s family 
begs and screams. Shah studies the Afghan deep into his eyes. 
Decides he’s lying...Shah nods to Taraq.
Taraq yanks the Afghan to his feet. As his children watch 
Taraq leads the pleading farmer outside. Into the woods.

Taraq and his men throw the Afghan down over a fallen log. 
Face up.

Two of Taraq’s men hold him by the beard as Taraq stands over 
him. Razor sharp machete up. 

Shah backlit. Ignoring the man’s pleading...as Taraq hacks 
down with brutal fury.

Tight on Shah, tight on Taraq, blood dripping from his hand.

MIKE MURPHY

Rooms a mess. Clothes and gear everywhere. Grenades on a desk

to a SEAL Flag, 8 x 10 head shot of Ron Burgundy.

Tight on Murphy. His eyes slowly open. Hold a moment. Murphy 
checks watch. 0500. Slow and smooth Murphy rises. Body 
strong. Not ripped. Effortless power.

Murphy goes to his computer. Opens it and checks his mail.

Tight on Murphy’s inbox.

A picture of an Arabian Horse. Murphy studies the picture.


MOVING DOWN HALLWAY

Murphy now in shorts and a Navy T-shirt. Holding his laptop, 
eating a banana. Stops by Luttrell’s door. Opens it.

Luttrell sleeps, Murphy sits on his bed. Nudges Luttrell.

Luttrell opens an eye. He’s staring at the computer pic of an 
Arabian horse.

             MURPHY
      Is this doable?

             LUTTRELL 
      Expensive.

             MURPHY
      How much?

             LUTTRELL
      Arabic. She’s got good taste.

             MURPHY
      How much?

             LUTTRELL
      I’ll find out. Expensive.

Murphy is up. Heads out the door. Moves into the hallway. 
Opens Dietz’s door.

                                        7.

      I’m up.


INT. GYM - CAMP OUELLETTE

Dark, then lights on, revealing a decent cross fit style gym.

Blackboard filled with the current workout leaders. Dietz and 
Murphy hold most of them.

The two men start to stretch in silence.

Luttrell wanders in. A giant bowl of cereal.

             LUTTRELL
      Since when does she want an Arabic 
      horse?

             MURPHY
      Since I got an email this morning.  
      Probably saw it on Oprah. 

             LUTTRELL
      Oprah rides Arabic horses?

             MURPHY
      I don’t know what Oprah does.

             LUTTRELL
      She can afford them.

             MURPHY
      Why? How much do they cost?

             LUTTRELL
      I don’t know. Oprah money.

             MURPHY
      Fuck.

             LUTTRELL
      I thought you guys were doing this 
      tomorrow.

Murphy and Dietz strap on Body Armor.

      Maybe I’m starting to become tele 
      fucking pathic - non-verbal yoda or 
      something. I could swear I just 
      said outloud, that I thought this 
      was happening tomorrow.

Murphy stretching. 

             MURPHY
      I think Red Wings a go. Tonight.

             LUTTRELL
      Oh.

      Outstanding.

SHANE PATTON wanders in.

             SHANE PATTON
      You’re doing it now?

The three men ignore Shane.

             SHANE PATTON
	(CONT’D)

      They’re going at it now?

             LUTTRELL

INT. MATT AXELSON’S BUNK - MORNING

Axe sleeps. His computer alarm goes off. Incoming voice chat.

Slowly Axe reaches down for the computer on his floor.

Axe opens the computer. Signs in.

Incoming from his wife Cindy.

“Are you up?”

Axe types.

“Yes my love.”

Cindy.

“What you doing?”

Axe stares at a picture of he and Cindy.

                                        9.

“Looking at you.”

      Thought you guys were doing this 
      tomorrow...

             MURPHY
      Ready?

             DIETZ
      Yup.

             LUTTRELL
      Mark. Set. Go.

Luttrell hits the stop watch.

Murphy and Dietz leap to bars, 75 Pull-ups as fast as 
possible. Brief pauses to recover. 100 push ups. Dietz 
slightly ahead of Murphy. Sprints out of the gym. Murphy 
close behind.

The two men charge up and over the gate. Body Armor on.

Murphy and Dietz running hard racing each other on a two mile 
lap of the Air Base.

      I don’t know.

             SHANE PATTON
      You know.

             LUTTRELL
      If I say I don’t know. I don’t 
      know.

             SHANE PATTON
      You know.

             LUTTRELL
      If you go you’ll go. If you don’t 
      go, trust me you will go. 
      Eventually. Comprende?

             SHANE PATTON
      So, I’m not going?

             LUTTRELL
      I didn’t say that.

             SHANE PATTON
      You said if you don’t go, you will 
      eventually go.

             LUTTRELL
      Yea, that’s not saying your not 
      going.

             SHANE PATTON

             LUTTRELL
      Murphy.  Barely.

             AXE
      Head shave?

Dietz looks pained. 

             MURPHY
      Man...I got to think this one out. 
      If I shave his head, I’m going to 
      have to look at him. Really look at 
      him. Ears, face, funny shaped 
      head...I don’t know. Marcus? What 
      do you think?

             LUTTRELL
      I don’t know boss...I don’t want to 
      be looking at him that close 
      either, but he has been running his 
      mouth about beating you...a lot. 
      Head shave is fair.

             MURPHY
      Axe?

                                       12.

             AXE
      Hell yea, I say shave him, and he 
      can’t eat with us, make him eat 
      with E3 Marines until it grows 
      back. Shave the boy.

             MURPHY
      Shane?

             SHANE PATTON
      Well, I could go both ways on this. 
      He did lose but, he was close and 
      you’re Mike Murphy and I would have 
      expected a much bigger separation. 
      Plus, we’re at war and there’s the 
      whole Samson thing, so I’m not 
      sure. I’ll plead the fifth on this 
      one.

Murphy looks stares at Shane.

             SHANE PATTON
	(CONT’D)
      But you’re the boss, boss. So I’m 
      with you. I’ll shave his head, wax 
      his balls if you give me the order. 
      Sir, I’ll wax my own balls if you 
      take me on Red Wings.

Murphy shakes his head at Patton, looks over to Dietz.

             DANNY
      Come on Mike. 

             MURPHY
      Yea Danny this is probably not 
      gonna go your way. Shane, get my 
      razor.

             SHANE PATTON
      Getting razor, copy that.

             MURPHY
      What’s that?

             AXE
      The guys got no earlobes.

Silence as the team studies the image.

             SHANE
      What are earlobes for anyway?

             DIETZ
      Piercing and balance.

             SHANE 
      Balance.

             DIETZ
      I heard earlobes are key for head 
      balance - equilibrium.  Cut a guys 
      ear off, he’s gonna suck on a drunk 
      test, balance beam, tight rope...

             LUTTRELL
      False.  Earlobes have no biological  
      functions for humans.  Fish can use 
      earlobes like a valve to open or 
      close the ear canal.


             SHANE
      Why would a fish want to let water  
      into his ear canal? 

Luttrell shoots him a look - “shut the fuck up”

                                       15.

Murphy keeps things moving.

             MURPHY
      Bad guy.  Senior Taliban commander 
      responsible for killing Marines in 
      Eastern Afghanistan and sport 
      killing civilians in the Hindu-
      Kush. Considered Tier One target 
      rumored to be close to Bin Laden. 
      Axe is going to go over our route 
      in.

             AXE
      The helo pilots are going to do two 
      false inserts.  Then drop us off at 
      our primary insert, located here.  
      Secondary insert located here.  
      From our primary insert, our 
      bearing will be zero three zero 
      patrolling 1.5 kilometers to our 
      designated lay up point.  We will 
      be moving up the backside of this 
      mountain which will offer us good 
      concealment from the target but the 
      terrain is gonna be rocky so watch 
      your footing.  I’m estimating it’s 
      gonna take us about two hours to 
      complete.  

             MURPHY
      Luttrell - medical

             LUTTRELL
      First things first, win the fight.  
      There’s no medicine in a gunfight.  
      It’s self aid, buddy aid, corpsman 
      aide.  Two weeks ago, Team 3 was 
      near where you guys will be. 
      Capelli got bit by a rattlesnake. 
      and contrary to popular belief, 
      there is poison oak, so watch the 
      cock and balls cause that will 
      suck.  Drink lots of water, wear 
      sunscreen, and Dietz bring your own 
      chapstick.  

Dietz stands up, starts talking comms

             DIETZ 
      Crypto will be wide band, segment 2-
      4. Murph’s got a SAT phone. Region 
      is very steep so expect typical 
      comms problems. We’ll be on two 
      hour comms windows. 

             DIETZ 
	(CONT'D)
      If we miss two windows I’d say wake 
      somebody up. Other than that, don’t 
      sweat it.

Murphy picks up a plastic AC-130 and holds it over the map.

                                      15A.

             MURPHY
      AC-130 is with us?

Dietz takes the plane from Murphy. Moves it over the map.

                                       16.

             DIETZ
      Correct. Just for the infil. All 
      comms will be relayed through the 
      AC-130, call sign Apollo. Suns up, 
      she’s out.  Some of the key pro-
      words - when we have a successful 
      insert, Budweiser.  When we’re 
      halfway through infil, it’ll be 
      Corona.  At our observation point, 
      Schlitz Malt Liquor.  And if we 
      positively identify Shah: 
      touchdown.  

Danny chucks the toy plane.

             MURPHY
      Reaction Force is the following:
      The 47’s will relocate to J-Bad 
      overnight. 

Murphy uses toy plastic helicopters to explain the size and 
location of the QRF.

             KRISTENSEN
      That’s correct. You’ll have fifteen 
      team guys, and about a dozen 
      Marines standing by all night. When 
      we hear Schlitz Malt Liquor, we’re 
      heading back to Bagram for phase 2. 
      QRF will stay here - we’re leaving 
      you with 4 team guys, 20 marines, 2 
      Blackhawks and 2 Apaches. The 
      Apaches stay with the Blackhawks.  

The toy Choppers circle on the map giving us a clear 
understanding of the playing field.

             KRISTENSEN
	(CONT’D)
      The movement is so we can get the 
      47’s back here and be ready to 
      bring it for phase two once you get 
      eyes on Shah. Remember - comms will 
      most likely be intermittent and 
      there are reports that non-
      combatants are being used as recon 
      elements for the enemy.  

             MURPHY
      Roger that.

Luttrell spits chew. Danny doodles furious, mashing demons. 
Axe quietly studies the picture of Ahmad Shah.

JAG GOES OVER RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

             AXE
      Lotta moving parts.

             MURPHY
      What we do, when we do, what we do.

             KRISTENSEN
      We go in four hours. I’m pulling up 
      tomorrow’s new guy presentation to 
      1800 tonight so that all may revel 
      and partake.

             SHANE PATTON
      Are you serious?

             KRISTENSEN
      Yes.  Glorious evening gentlemen.  


EXT. BAGRAM

The four SEALs moving through the massive base. Long hair, 
bearded. Surfers with handguns stuck in waistbands. Sharp 
contrast to the hundreds of uniformed buzz-cutted Rangers and 
Marines. 

They move at us, holding trays loaded with food. 


EXT. OULLETTE SEAL COMPOUND - CAMO CANOPY


LAST SUPPER. 
Murphy, Luttrell, Axe and Dietz. Eating. Having a fly catch 
and kill competition. 
DIETZ looks stressed.
He’s got a paint tile sample page on the table in front of 
him. Studying paint samples.

             DIETZ
      We were gonna wait but she’s all 
      into it and when she gets her head 
      into something, that’s it. There’s 
      no stopping her.


             MURPHY
      So just let her do it.  It’s good 
      for her. You got a handy man woman. 
      That’s good.

                                       18.

MURPHY kills a fly. Places the dead fly by his coffee cup 
next to three other dead flies.

             DIETZ
      I don’t know.

             MURPHY
      Don’t know what?

             DIETZ
      I don’t know.

             MURPHY
      What?

             AXE
      He’s worried that he’s losing 
      control over his castle.

             MURPHY
      Really.

             AXE
      Ask him.

             MURPHY
      Are you worried that you’re losing 
      control over your castle?

             DIETZ
      Shut up Murph.

             MURPHY
      Are you?

             LUTTRELL
      He’s having control issues cause 
      he’s the one whose always made the 
      “taste” issues in the family.

             DIETZ
      She’s got great taste. I trust her. 

             MURPHY
      So what’s the problem?

             DIETZ
      It’s not a problem. It’s just very 
      ongoing. Know what I mean?

Luttrell kills a fly. He’s got six dead ones. He and Murphy 
are competing.

                                       19.

             MURPHY
      Not really. No. Marcus, you know 
      what he means?

             LUTTRELL
      Control issues.

             MURPHY
      Is that right?

             DIETZ
      No.

             LUTTRELL
      Yes.

             DIETZ
      It’s not control issues.

             MURPHY
      What is it?

             DIETZ
      New grass leads to new bushes by 
      the window, leads to new windows, 
      leads to new curtains, leads to new 
      sofa, leads to new rug, leads to 
      new floor...

             MURPHY
      Got it.

             LUTTRELL
      Loss of control.  Got to let that 
      go bro.

             DIETZ
      It’s like this weird journey that 
      she’s on. Moving through the house 
      one room to the next.

             AXE
      Where is she now?

             DIETZ
      Kitchen. I think.

Murphy and Luttrell both kill flies at the same time. Marines 
with Buzz cuts in crisp uniform eating all around the SEALs. 
Stark contrast.

Tight on Shane Patton. Doing his best Napoleon Dynamite 
dance. He is not good. SEALs in lounge chairs.  They watch, 
laugh and taunt. Music loud. Shane powers through. Finishes

Whistles and clapping from the SEALs. AXE stands up. Puts an 
arm around Patton.

      Ok, here’s the deal. That sucked,

      Come on Mikey.

             MURPHY
      Can he say it?

Other SEALs agree. Shouting out. Debating whether Shane can 
“say it”. Making bets.

AXE knows what Murphy is thinking. Pauses. Looks at Shane.

             AXE
        (quiet to Shane)
      Can you say it?

             SHANE PATTON

      I can say it.

             AXE
      Ok. Shut up. Shut the fuck up. He 
      can say it. Shut up.

The room silences.  Patton, nervous, takes a deep breath.

      It’s not an argument.

cockpit. 

             PILOT
        (on radio)
      Ropes. Ropes. Ropes.

Fast rope dropped. Chopper jet engines screaming, the four 
Opp SEALs up. The remaining twenty will be relocated and 
stand by as QRF. Axe up and out first, then Danny, Murphy, 
out into the black night. Luttrell last one, hand on the 
rope, fist pounds Shane.

Murphy is the first to have binoculars up and is looking down 
hill, way down hill at the Afghan village. 2,000 ft., very 
steep, cliff like. Below them.

DANNY’S POV:

100 stone and wood homes, well-constructed. Looks almost 
charming. A couple of dozen Afghan villagers in different 
parts of the village, kids playing, women cooking, two men 
working on a roof. Looks quite peaceful.

Left: trying to see the rest of the village. Can’t get a good 
view, a mountain is blocking his view. 

Danny has the radio out and is calling in the arrival pro-
word.

             DANNY
        (on radio)
      Beastmaster, this is Spartan 01, 
      radio check.

INT. J-BAD TOC


In the TOC, SGT HASSLERT takes the call from Dietz. Heavy 
static. Weak signal.

                                       28.

             HASSLERT
      Spartan 01, this is Beastmaster.  I 
      have you weak but readable

             DANNY
      Beastmaster, this is Spartan 01.  I  
      pass Schlitz Malt liquor.  How 
      copy?  

Really weak signal.

             HASSLERT
      Spartan 01 this is Beastmaster.  
      Say again your last - you are weak 
      and unreadable.  

             DANNY
      Beastmaster, this is Spartan 01.  I 
      pass Schlitz Malt Liquor, how copy.  

             HASSLERT
      Spartan 01, this is Beastmaster.  
      Good copy.   

Hasslert looks to Kristensen.

             HASSLERT
	(CONT’D)
      Sketchy comms, sir. Spartan 01 has 
      arrived.

Erik Kristensen sitting. Nods. Gets up. Checks the wall 
clock: 6:45 AM

             KRISTENSEN
      Ok.

He stretches, cracks his back, looks to a couple of SEALs 
manning the TOC.

             KRISTENSEN
	(CONT’D)
      Later fellas. Night, night.

Track out the door with Kristensen, as he, Shane, and Healy 
step out of the TOC into the bright Afghan sunshine.

             KRISTENSEN
	(CONT’D)
      Glorious day.
Kristensen and all but four SEALs head to the waiting 47’s, 
start boarding.
Kristensen looks to Musslemen, a SEAL who is staying with the 
QRF.

                                       29.

             KRISTENSEN
	(CONT’D)
      All yours brother.

             MUSSLEMEN
      Roger that Skipper.

Kristensen boards his 47 and the two choppers lift off 
heading back to Bagram.
Two Blackhawks and two Apaches standing by on the tarmac.


EXT. HINDU KUSH - SCHLITZ MALT LIQUOR WAYPOINT


Axelson and Luttrell together, spotting scopes out, they 
study the village. 

             LUTTRELL
      Can’t see half the village. 

             MURPHY
      Yea.

They study the surrounding area.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      Let’s move down towards that peak, 
      see if that’s not better.

             LUTTRELL
      Sounds good.

Luttrell looks back at Axe and Dietz. He soft whistles and 
rolls his index finger, points down towards the peak below 
them. 

Axe and Danny immediately get it. They start moving out.


INT. J-BAD TOC

PETE MUSSLEMEN, one of the four SEALs left as part of the QRF 
in J-Bad, walks into the TOC. Looks to Hasslert.

             MUSSLEMEN
      Are we good?

             HASSLERT
      Yes sir. They arrived about half 
      hour ago. Should be digging in nice 
      and tight right about now.

Musslemen checks the clock on the J-Bad TOC.

                                       30.

Tight on clock.

7:15 AM 


EXT. HINDU KUSH 

Moving, far from tucked in, over Murphy’s back as he moves up 
towards his new spot.

Murphy, low crawling, gets close to the ledge.

The four SEALs crawling out to the new lookout spot. Murphy’s 
got his binoculars out. 

NEW POV:

A perfect, clear, unobstructed view of the entire Afghan 
village. 

             MURPHY
      We’re good.

Danny, on radio, trying to call in that they’ve relocated. 
Can’t get through. 

             DANNY
        (to Murphy)
      No joy. 

             MURPHY
      Keep trying.

As the team sets up, Dietz is looking up at the small 
mountain behind him that seems to be killing his radio.

Series of shots:

Murphy and Luttrell scopes up, start counting Taliban. At 
forty, Luttrell looks to Murphy.

             LUTTRELL
      That’s more than 10.

             MURPHY
      Yes.

Murphy is focused on a group of four men off to the side of 
the village playing a game with stones. Seeing who can throw 
the farthest.

DOWN IN VILLAGE

Shah and Taraq with three soldiers playing stone throwing 
game. Laughing. Shah throws his stone. The men argue over who 
threw further. 


HIDE

Murphy locks his sight on Shah. Studying him.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      Marcus. 

Murphy hands the scope to Luttrell.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      Four guys on the right. Tall guy. 
      Red scarf. No earlobes.

Luttrell’s scope now trained on Shah.

Luttrell and Murphy both checking wrist bands. Photo of Shah.  
Clear match.

             LUTTRELL
      Bingo.  

             MURPHY
      Do you have a shot?  

             LUTTRELL
      Jesus Mickey, with this little 556?  
      I’d need to stalk at least a 1000 
      yards closer. 

             MURPHY
      Gotta call it in.  

Murphy turns to Dietz

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      Can you make the fucking radio 
      work?  

Dietz tries to call it in - no luck.  

Luttrell following Shah’s face with scope. Finger on trigger.

VILLAGE

Shah arguing with his soldiers over who threw further. 
Proclaims himself winner. Moves out of village into woods.

HIDE

Luttrell’s POV:


Shah disappears from sight.

Murphy gets Axe’s attention.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      Axe, stay put.  Keep eyes on, we’re 
      gonna move back.  

Murphy, Luttrell and Dietz get up; moves away from the ridge 
line, start building their hides.


ABOVE THE RIDGELINE -- 


Marcus and Murphy talk as they work.

                                       31.

             LUTTRELL
      If we’re home by the 15th, me and 
      Morgan are gonna cut down all the 
      trees behind the stable.

             MURPHY
      How does that help me?

             LUTTRELL
      Brahms horse auction is, I think 
      the 27th.

             MURPHY
      Is he selling Arabic horses? 
      Kristensen says I should get her 
      whatever Silver was.  

             LUTTRELL
      Silver?

             MURPHY
      Hi-Ho Silver. Lone Ranger’s horse.

             LUTTRELL
      Yea that’s a badass horse. 

             MURPHY
      She doesn’t want a badass horse. 
      She wants an Arabic horse.

             LUTTRELL
      Dude, how’s she going to know the 
      difference. Get her a Quarter 
      Horse, tell her it’s an Arabic. If 
      she busts you, tell her if it’s 
      good enough for the Lone Ranger...

             MURPHY
      How much for an Arabic?

             LUTTRELL
      Probably around 15 grand.

             MURPHY
      Fuck.

             LUTTRELL
      Hell of a wedding present.

             MURPHY
      Yea.

             LUTTRELL
      Is the redhead a bridesmaid?

                                      31A.

             MURPHY
      Melissa?

             LUTTRELL
      The redhead?

             MURPHY
      Melissa?

             LUTTRELL
      The redhead from the Coldplay 
      concert?

             MURPHY
      That’s Melissa.

             LUTTRELL
      Is she coming?

                                       32.

             MURPHY
      She’s a fucking bridesmaid.

             LUTTRELL
      I love her.

             MURPHY
      Get me a deal on the horse. I’ll 
      get that done.

             LUTTRELL
      That works.

- Powerful scopes and cameras.

- Luttrell and Axe draw detailed maps, diagrams, blueprints 
of every structure in the village.
Luttrell photos Arab men with weapons moving through the 
town. CLEARLY A TALIBAN PRESENCE.
- Dietz photographs windows, doors, detailed notes on hinges, 
wall thickness, structure, etc..

- Murphy taking the drawings, photoshopping them on a 
Toughbook computer.

Dietz eats a PowerBar. Axe watches him.

             AXE
      Shouldn’t eat that shit.

             DIETZ
      Why?

             AXE
      Toxic.

             DIETZ
      You eat em...

             AXE
      Never.

             DIETZ
      I’ve seen you eat PowerBars.

             AXE
      Never. I don’t eat shit bars.

             DIETZ
       Shit bars?

                                       33.

             AXE
      Why you eating a shit bar?

Dietz pauses. Pulls his eyes off his scope.

             DIETZ
      I’m eating it because I’m hungry.

             AXE
      Eat an apple.

             DIETZ
      I know what I’m eating.

             AXE
      Negative.

Axe reading the list of ingredients commenting on each one.

             DIETZ
      I know exactly what I’m eating. 

                                       34.


LATER. 

- Dietz sleeps.

- Murphy eats an apple.

- Axe up top on security.

- Luttrell throws berries at a sleeping Dietz.

- Axe studies the village.

POV AXE:

Ahmad Shah moving through village. Taraq and two men with 
him, all armed.


             MURPHY
      Danny your on, everybody else shut 
      her down.

- Luttrell, Axe, and Murphy settle in to sleep.

- Dietz, glasses up, studies the village. 


EXT. HINDU KUSH - MORNING

                                       35.

                                FADE OUT:

Sun getting higher. Low fog. Murphy, Axe, Luttrell sleep. 
Danny on watch. Wedged into a tree stump. 

ON DANNY.
Tired but awake. Alert. Quietly singing to himself.
TIGHT ON DANNY. His eyes a micro shift of focus. He stills 
himself ever so slightly.

DANNY’s POV

He’s looking down hill. Wide gentle slope of the mountain 
leading to a sharper drop. The fire lights up the village far 
below.

Nothing moves.

BACK to Danny. Eyes more focused. He slowly reaches down and 
kills the iPod. 

Silence. Danny studies the hill with increasing focus.

POV.

Nothing moves. 

The three SEALs sleep.

Tight on Luttrell. Sleeping.

THEN a very faint sound from down hill. Silence. Then 
another. 

Luttrell slowly opens his eyes. Listening. 

Another sound, a soft bell.

Marcus shifts, looks down hill.

Marcus’s POV

Looking down hill. Nothing moving. The sounds becoming more 
present. Bells.

Tight on Luttrell. Looking.

BACK TO HIS POV

The empty hill. More Bells. Then cresting the hill. First 
just the tips of the ears. Then the forehead, nose, face....

                                       36.

A large male goat.

Bell ringing gently from his neck.

TIGHT ON MARCUS

Studying the goat.

As another goat appears. Then another...then another...then 
twenty...

A herd of goats moving up the hill right at them.

Marcus is wide awake, eyes scanning the hill scanning the 
goats when... 

A human head crests the hill. A young Afghan BOY, ten years 
old. 

Luttrell reaches for his Mark 12, looks over to Axe still 
sleeping. Then to Murph still sleeping. Then back to Danny.

Danny’s already on scope. Gun aimed at the approaching kid 
when...

Two more Afghan MEN crest the hill - an old man and a 
teenager.

The hill is full of goats. More than a hundred with the three 
Afghans moving straight at the SEALs.

The goat bells and baying of the animals creating serious 
noise. Murph and Axe both waking up.

Weapons coming up as they silently take in this bizarre 
situation.

Back to Marcus as the first goat passes by. Then another.

Tight on lead Afghan boy...THE GOAT BOY.

He’s heading dangerously close to Luttrell’s hide singing 
quietly to himself.

Tight on Luttrell. Gun up and trained on the goat boy as he 
gets closer...closer...and then in a one in a million...this 
fucking goat boy takes one more step and comes down square on 
Luttrell’s head.

                                       37.

Luttrell moves, the kid screams, Luttrell’s up, gun 
up...screaming. 

             LUTTRELL
      Get the fuck down.

Axe, Danny, and Murphy. Guns up moving in fast on the 
terrified goat men...

             DANNY 
      Down Down Down.

The kid screams and starts running downhill towards the 
village. AXE sprints on him fast, takes the kid down, hand 
over mouth.

Kid bites and struggles wild.

Goats running in fear as the three Afghans are roughly thrown 
down. Searched, a military style Motorola walkie talkie taken 
from the old man, flex-cuffed and gagged...

When it’s done the four SEALs stand over them. Murphy looking 
at Luttrell.

             MURPHY
      Fuck.

Murphy looks to Dietz.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
        (re: radio)
      Can you get a call out or what?

Dietz reaches for his radio.

INT. J-BAD TOC 

In the radio room. Musselman and Comms guys by their radios. 
SILENT. Clearly Spartan 01 is not getting through.

BACK ON THE MOUNTAIN

The goats spread out, grazing, bells ringing loud. a large 
dog, mouth foaming, growls and bark at the team.

Luttrell raises his Mark 12 at the dog when it gets too 
close.

Murphy is trying to interrogate the older man with a 
translation box. He speaks into it and it’s supposed to 
translate into Pashto.

                                       38.

They have separated the older man from the boys. Murphy and 
Luttrell have them off to the side.. Axe stands watch over 
the boy.

             MURPHY
        (speaking into the Phrase-
         O-Later)
      Are you looking for Americans? 

A robotic-like voice used for making out the question in 
Arabic.

The old man stares at Murphy with a combination of hatred and 
confusion.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      Do the Taliban know we are up here?

Death stare from the old man.

Murphy getting frustrated. Louder.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      Do they know?

The old man stares, finally says something quiet. Too quiet 
for the translating machine. Murphy puts the mic closer.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      Say again. Are you Taliban?

The old man rants on as the machine struggles to translate 
his slang Pashtun.

             TRANSLATION MACHINE
      Do not drink with many blood rooms 
      fire and knives...

             MURPHY
      This fuckin thing’s not working...

The machine starts translating what Murphy is saying.  

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      Shut the fuck up ! 

Murphy throws the machine on the ground.

The dog makes another move at Luttrell. Fangs mashing. 
Luttrell raises his gun. The dog backs down.


EXT. BACK ON THE MOUNTAIN

Danny continues to try his radio.

                                       39.

             DANNY
      Spartan 01, Spartan base...Spartan 
      01, Spartan base...

Nothing.

Murphy standing just off the group calls Luttrell over.

             MURPHY
      Marcus.

Leaving Axe on security. Luttrell moves up the hill fifty 
feet with Murphy.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      What do you think?

             LUTTRELL
      Murphy’s God Awful law. Not you 
      Mikey. The other prick. The God of 
      screw-ups. 

             MURPHY
      Yea.

             LUTTRELL
      Soft Compromise bro.

             MURPHY
      Yea. I’m aware of that.
Murphy digs into his pack, pulls out his SATELLITE PHONE. 
Checks numbers on his wrist pad. Dials up J-Bad TOC (Command 
Center).

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
        (a touch frustrated: to 
         Dietz)
      I’m now going to be that guy 
      calling on a fucking unsecure Sat 
      line because your radio is not 
      functioning.

             DIETZ

      need to speak to the CO 
      immediately.

             HASSLERT
      The CO?

      morning.

                                       41.

Murphy realizing he’s made a mistake.

      I know that can you please transfer 
      this call to BAGRAM OUELLETTE TOC.

             HASSLERT
      Roger that. Stand by.

             MURPHY 
      Standing by.

Silence Murphy looks down at the goat herders. Moves over to 
Danny with the radio. Holding up his SAT phone.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
        (re: SAT phone)
      Handing them our goddamned

Tight on Murphy, the realization of how fucked they are is 
starting to settle in.

	(CONT’D)
      What’s the fucking problem?

             DANNY
      Don’t know.

A horrible connection.

Patton is confused. He knows that Murphy and his team are way 
deep on their opp.

             SHANE PATTON
      Mike?

             MURPHY
      Is this Shane?

             SHANE PATTON
      It’s Shane. What’s up Mike? This 
      connection sucks.

             MURPHY
      Are you not receiving our 
      transmissions?

             SHANE PATTON
      Radio calls? Not in a while.

Patton yells over to the Comms guys.

                                       43.

             SHANE PATTON
	(CONT’D)
      Are you all hearing anything from 
      SPARTAN 1.

             COMMS GUY
      When? We’ve been communicating.

             SHANE PATTON
        (back on the phone)
      They say they are communicating 
      with you.

             MURPHY
      Say again.

             SHANE PATTON
      Comms says that you are good. Copy?

             MURPHY
      In the last twenty minutes?

             SHANE PATTON
        (back to comms guy)
      You talked in the last twenty 
      minutes? 

             COMMS GUY
      Negative.

             SHANE PATTON
        (into phone)
      Negative Murph.

             MURPHY
      I need the skipper now.

             SHANE PATTON
      He’s sleeping sir.

             MURPHY
      Wake him up now.

Murphy’s voice is electronically garbled.

             SHANE PATTON
      Did you say wake him up sir?

             MURPHY
      Right the fuck now!

             SHANE PATTON
      Roger that.

                                       44.

EXT. BAGRAM TOC.

SHANE PATTON barefooted jogs out of the TOC moves through a 
series of plywood barracks. Knocks on a door.

             SHANE PATTON
      Skipper. Skipper.

He knocks harder. 

             SHANE PATTON
	(CONT’D)
      SKIPPER!

From inside.

             KRISTENSEN
        (oc)
      What?

             SHANE PATTON
      Sir sorry sir. I’ve got Lieutenant 
      Murphy on the phone in the TOC. 
      Says he needs to talk to you. Now.

A moment, then Kristensen’s door flies open. Kristensen in 
his underwear, flip flops, moving out, clearly just waking 
up.

Track with them as Kristensen moves back into the TOC.
Reaches for the phone.

             KRISTENSEN
        (into phone)
      Mike?

Silence Static.

             KRISTENSEN
	(CONT'D)
      Mike...? Mike...? Try him back.

PATTON reads Murphy’s SAT phone number off the board.
Dials. Waits. Nothing. Tries again nothing.

             KRISTENSEN
	(CONT'D)
      Is it dead?

             SHANE PATTON
      Yes sir.

             KRISTENSEN
      What’d he want?

                                       45.

             SHANE PATTON
      No idea sir.

             KRISTENSEN
      Did he say anything?

             SHANE PATTON
      Just that he needed to speak to 
      you.

             KRISTENSEN
      Anything wrong?

             SHANE PATTON
      Didn’t say sir.

Stay with Kristensen a bit concerned. Looking at the map of 
the Valley. 
TIGHT ON KRISTENSEN
Thinking.....

EXT. HINDU KUSH MOUNTAIN

Murphy trying his IRIDIUM SAT phone one more time.

             MURPHY
      Can someone explain to me why they 
      both crash at the same time?
      LUTTRELL

Murphy’s law.
Murphy’s law
Now a last resort. Murphy keys his personal radio. An MBITR 
walkie talkie mounted on the side of his chest.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      Spartan 01 to anyone. Spartan 01 to 
      anyone listening. Over.

             LUTTRELL
      We could light these goats on fire 
      and smoke signal our way out of 
      here.

AXE

             DANNY
      I could go down to the village and 
      ask to borrow a phone.
Murphy just stares at the goat herders.

                                       46.

             MURPHY
        (quietly to himself)
      Fuck.

             LUTTRELL
      You’d get some interesting tile 
      ideas down there bro. Afghan Dirt 
      Brown. Goat skin blond, she’ll dig 
      that a hell of a lot more than what 
      is it Honey creme...?

The goat noise is now really loud. Dogs barking and Axe is 
getting focused. Doing the math.
The kid bolts. Hands cuffed behind his back, he’s still fast 
as shit.

             AXE
      Fuck me.

He charges again after the kid. Tackles him. Drags him back.

AXE breathing hard. Looking at Murphy.

             MURPHY
      I’m thinking three ways this plays 
      out. 

All eyes on Murphy. His brain churning.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      We let em go, we’re gonna fight. So 
      we can 1) Tie em up. Move out. 
      Probably take them 15 minutes to 
      get out.  2) Let em go. We hike 
      out. Roll dice. 

             DIETZ
      Three?

             AXE
      Three, soft Compromise. Terminate 
      the compromise.

Axe stares at Murphy. Third choice is obvious.
Murphy looks up to the mountain top a mile behind them. 

             MURPHY
      Can we get a signal from that 
      mountain?

                                       47.

             DANNY
      I thought about that. Probably. I 
      don’t fucking know.

More dog barking, goat baying, bells ringing. The kids are 
staring rage into the eyes of the Americans.

             DANNY
	(CONT’D)
      We gotta do something boss.

             MURPHY
      Yea.

Murphy walks back down to Luttrell and Axe.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      What do you think?

             LUTTRELL
      They don’t seem to like us very 
      much. 

             MURPHY
      Yea.

A pause. Reality setting in.

             AXE
      Shah’s down there. We let them go, 
      Shaw disappears. Mission fails. 

             MURPHY
      What? Kill them.

Axe stares at Murphy.  
Murphy staring at Axe. Realizing how serious he is.

             AXE
      We are compromised Mike. 

Marcus spits out some chew. Looking down, he shakes his head. 
A pained grin plasters his face.

             LUTTRELL
      Shit.

                                       48.

             MURPHY
      Danny?

Danny takes a long look at the goat herders. Finally...

             DANNY
      I don’t give a shit what you 
      decide. I’m not a lawyer. Just tell 
      me what to do Murph. You’re the big 
      bucks, earn em’.

Murphy turns to Marcus.

             MURPHY
      Marcus?

             LUTTRELL
      I don’t know Mikey.

Luttrell takes his time. The goats sound like they are 
howling. The vibe on the mountain is becoming deathly 
serious.

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT'D)
      I don’t know. I don’t like it. We 
      kill them. Yea ok. We kill them. 
      Bury them. They get found. Then 
      what... 

             AXE
      Then what?

             LUTTRELL
      I’m just saying. It ain’t gonna be 
      private. Gonna be out there for the 
      whole fucking world.  CNN -- SEALs 
      kill goat farmers.  I don’t want 
      that legacy, bro.  I’m not killing 
      goat farmers.  Not feeling that.  

                                       49.

             AXE
      I’m not either, but the
      Old man’s Tali and these kids can 
      shoot better than you can.

             LUTTRELL 
      Let’s just tie ‘em up and get the 
      fuck out of here.

             AXE
      We tie them up, we have no control 
      over when they get found; get free.  
      I will die before I let them 
      dictate when we die.  I will not 
      end up showing your body -- your 
      head -- on television.  On the 
      Computer.  No way, they do not get 
      that vote.

             LUTTRELL
      Then let’s just get the fuck out of 
      here.

             AXE
      I will do this, I will kill them 
      right now.  They will not harm you 
      or me or my wife or your wife or 
      any of our unborn children.  No.  
      These people are death and I will 
      not fucking bow to this.  

             MURPHY
      You want to kill, Axe? Really? 
      That’s your position?

             AXE
      I want to be playing golf with 
      Freddie Couples on Pebble Beach, 
      but I’m having a little trouble 
      getting a tee time.

             LUTTRELL
      If we kill these kids, it’s 
      International news. CNN doesn’t 
      care about Rules of Engagement. 
      SEALs kill kids. That’s the story. 
      Forever.

Tight on the guys taking this in. Murphy paces, staring 
intensely at one of the goat kids.

             MURPHY
       Axe what’s your call? 

                                      49A.

Axe stares at Murphy.

             AXE
        (sad grin)
      My final answer?

                                       50.

             MURPHY
      Your final answer.

             AXE
      Kill them.

This hits hard.

             MURPHY
      Danny?

Dietz stares at the tied up kids.

             DANNY
      It’s your call bro.

             MURPHY
      You don’t have an opinion?

             DANNY
      Yea I have an opinion. Two 
      opinions. One is that for the 
      record I don’t give a fuck what 
      anyone thinks about what the fuck 
      we do up here. We do what we do. 
      What we have to do. That’s it. 
      That’s our business.

             MURPHY
      What’s two?

             DANNY
      Two is, this is the Navy and you’re 
      the boss and your job is to be the 
      boss and my job is to do what I’m 
      fucking told.

             MURPHY
      Ok.

             DANNY
      So you tell me what to do and it 
      will be done.

Murphy looks to Marcus.

             MURPHY 
      Marcus what’s your call?

Luttrell seems to get that with Danny out, Murphy’s for 
letting them go, Axe wants them dead - he’s the tie-breaker.

                                       51.

             LUTTRELL
        (slowly shaking his head)
      No. I’d rather fight them straight 
      up. I don’t want to kill these 
      kids.

ON MURPHY.

Thinking. He looks around the area. Looking for a burial 
spot. Stabbing at the stone earth with his M4. Clearly no 
soft earth anywhere close.

             MURPHY
        (quiet)
      Fuck me.

Murphy stares down at the Afghan village. Then long and hard 
at the three Afghans. Finally turns back to goat herders. 

             DANNY
      Look at them. They fucking hate us. 
      We don’t know how many Hajji’s they 
      have down there. We can’t let them 
      go.

             LUTTRELL
      So now you have an opinion? I 
      thought you were standing by 
      waiting for your orders?
             AXE
      This opp is a soup sandwich. Been 
      so from the beginning. The pitch. 
      The rope.  Worst comms that I’ve 
      ever seen.  Soft intel, we are not 
      wearing vests, have no heavy 
      weapons, are weak in numbers.... 
      It’s a cursed opp.
             MURPHY
      Starting to feel like a cursed opp.
             LUTTRELL
      It’s not a cursed opp. There are no 
      fucking curses. Just Afghanistan. 
      That’s all. Everyday man. Devil’s 
      asshole.  

             AXE
      Shah just killed twenty marines 
      last week and we’re on him. We’ve 
      come this far and these people here 
      are him. They are a part of him. We 
      let them go. 

             AXE
	(CONT'D)
      We’re letting him go and why in the 
      fucking world does he have the 
      right to do that to us?

Axe is starring at LUTTRELL.

                                       52.

             AXE.
      Seriously Marcus. Why does he have 
      the right to do that to us?

             LUTTRELL
      I don’t see it that way.

             MURPHY
      So what is your fucking call bro?

             LUTTRELL
      Let them go. Shut it down.

Silence.
So if Murphy was taking a vote it seems like it’s one vote 
for killing them, one vote for letting them go, Danny is 
neutral.
This is all on MURPHY.
Murphy turns away from them, looking down the steep pitched 
mountain. The village far below.
Murphy thinks. Looks at the young kids. The old man.

             MURPHY
      Here’s what we’re gonna do. Pack 
      up. Everything. We’re gonna let ‘em 
      go and we’re gonna make the peak. 
      When we make the peak were gonna 
      make Comms. We’re calling QRF and 
      we’re getting out.

Silence as the guys take in the plan. Luttrell lets out a 
huge breath.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      That’s what we’re going to do.

             DANNY
      Roger that.

             LUTTRELL
      Yes sir.  

             MURPHY 
      Let’s move it.

Quick Shots.

The guys quickly breaking down their gear. 

The goat boy watching confused.

The older Goat herders. Defiant. Steel-eyed.


                                       53.

INT. SEAL TOC. BAGRAM.

Kristensen, Patton with Petty Officer Dan Healy, James Suh 
and some COMMS guys.
The Comms guys trying to get Spartan 01 back on line.

             COMMS GUY
      Spartan 01, Spartan 01, over.

Kristensen is on the phone, communicating with J-Bad TOC

             KRISTENSEN
      When was your last contact with 
      Spartan 01?


EXT. J-BAD TOC.

The two Blackhawks standing by with the two Apaches.
The Apache pilots are firing up their engines.
Musslemen comes out of a pilot station.

             MUSSLEMEN
      Where are you guys going?

             APACHE PILOT
      We just got called North. By an 
      Army 372, evidently they took some 
      small fire. 

             MUSSLEMEN
      We’re QRF, bro.

             APACHE PILOT
      That’s what we thought. BAGRAM is 
      now QRF. 

             MUSSLEMEN
      The 47s?

             APACHE PILOT
      Correct.

             MUSSLEMEN
      Are we not the QRF now?

             APACHE PILOT
      That’s my understanding.

Mussleman is a bit confused...

Apache pilots climb into their two birds.
Take off.

EXT. MOUNTAIN
 
10 MINUTES LATER:

                                       54.

Gear packed the four SEALs stand over the Afghans.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      Everybody good?

Quick nods from the team as Murphy’s flip knife comes out. He 
quickly cuts through the flex cuffs. Freeing the Afghans.

             MURPHY
      You three just won the lottery. 
      Speak well of us. 

An odd moment as the Afghans stare at the SEALs. Not fully 
understanding that they are free to leave.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      Go!

The little goat boy stares at Murphy. A beat then gets it. 
Turning fast he takes off sprinting down the hill. 

The old man holds a beat. Says something quietly to the team.

Sounds fairly ominous.

Then he too turns and slowly, deliberately starts making his 
way down the long steep mountain.

Murphy looks at the team. 

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      Let’s move it.

The four SEALs, full gear, start moving up the mountain.

There is no trail. Just steep rocks, fallen trees, and a 
brutal pitch. 

THE YOUNG GOAT BOY. 

RUNNING DOWN THE HILL.

                                       55.

Leaping over rocks. Fallen trees. The kid’s movements are 
beautiful. Mountain agility in his DNA. Virtually FLYING down 
the mountain.

UP TOP.

Slow going for the SEALs. Murphy leading. Danny, loaded up 
with COMMS, second. Luttrell breathing hard. Axe bringing up 
the rear.

On AXE 

Constantly checking behind him. 

His left foot catches on some loose granite. Gives out. 

Axe rolls his ankle hard. Slips, falls hard sliding fast 
tumbling and smashing hard into a fallen tree stump. 

Sprained right ankle and bruised left ribs.

Murphy stops, looking back as Luttrell moves down to Axe. 

Axe struggling back on his feet.

             LUTTRELL.
      You ok?

             AXE
      Fucking Afghanistan.

             LUTTRELL.
      Yea. I’m the one who’s supposed to 
      be falling.

             AXE
      I’m fine.

He takes a step. White flash of burst pain tears through him. 
He buckles. Clearly not alright.

THE GOAT KID

Running hard approaching the village.

UP TOP.

Luttrell reaches for him. Axe pulls away.

             AXE
	(CONT'D)
      I’m good. Let’s go.

Axe digs his foot in. Grinds through the pain and starts back 
up the hill.

                                       56.

             AXE
	(CONT'D)
      Maybe we should just hike down to 
      the village, ask to borrow a phone.

Tight on Murphy’s small smile as he digs it up the hill. 

The group now moving even slower cause of Axe’s ankle.


EXT. THE VILLAGE.

Quiet. A couple of small fires. Some cooking. A group of 
young boys playing with sticks. Women cooking as - The young 
GOAT BOY comes tearing, full sprint into the village.

TIGHT ON THE GOAT BOY. Eyes wide.

Screaming for Shah.

Villagers start to gather. Shah approaches the boys. 
Breathing hard, they point up the mountain.

A couple of Taliban hear this. Take off into the woods.

TRACKING with the two Taliban. 

As they sprint deeper into the woods. Into the Taliban camp.

Taliban soldiers sleeping. The two find Shah and Taraq. Tell 
them about the Americans.
Shah quickly on his walkie talkie, old school but deathly 
effective. Rounding up his fighters.
Quick shots of the Taliban army. Feels like 150 men. Arming 
themselves. AK’s, RPG’s, grenades, a lot of ammo. Radio gear.

Quiet, cool, professional. These Afghan soldiers are loading 
up big time...


EXT. UP MOUNTAIN.


The SEALs cresting the hill. 

             MURPHY
      Fuck.

He’s looking up at a larger hill in front of them. They have 
just ascended a false summit. Still blocked in by another 
very steep mountain.

      Danny?

                                       57.

Dietz is already into the radio, as Luttrell and Axe spread 
out, digging in, guns pointed down hill.

             DANNY
        (on radio)
      Anvil 1 this is Spartan 01, over.

Nothing.

             MURPHY
      Great.

Comms still clearly dead. Murphy weighing his options. They 
are high above the village. Murphy pulls out binoculars. 
Scanning the village and mountain.

All three SEALs on glass. SCANNING.

SEALS POV

Nothing moving. From their vantage the town seems quiet. 
Business as usual.

They cannot see the Taliban off in the woods. They are 
OBLIVIOUS to the magnitude of the threat.

                                  CUT TO:


TWENTY MINUTES LATER.

Danny still working the radio. Axe has tightened his boot.  
Murphy and Luttrell have spread out on the hill. Staring down 
at the village.

Murphy’s got his SAT phone out. Trying to get a signal. 
Can’t.

He’s looking with disgust at the mountain behind him, knowing 
that it’s blocking his signal.

             MURPHY
        (to mountain)
      Move Bitch.

Luttrell’s fifteen feet to his left.

             LUTTRELL
      What do you want to do?

             MURPHY
      Go home, get in bed, and watch 
      Anchorman.

                                       58.

             LUTTRELL
      Check.

             MURPHY
      I wanna be on you.

             LUTTRELL
      Roger that. Should I spread the 
      word?

             MURPHY
      Not just yet. Let’s hold up for an 
      hour and see just how big of a can 
      of hell we’ve opened.

             LUTTRELL
      What do you think?

             MURPHY
      We did the right thing.  We let our 
      love light shine. God ought to be 
      smiling down on us. Isn’t that how 
      it works? Good things happen to 
      good people?

             LUTTRELL
      You think they’re coming after us?

             MURPHY
      Like a pack of wild dogs.

MURPHY keys his radio. 

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      What say you Axe?

             AXE
        (on radio)
      I’m fine.

Murphy looks up behind him to the large cliff. 

             MURPHY
        (to Axe)
      You good to go?

             AXE
      No problems boss.

             MURPHY
      Here’s the deal. Lay low here.  
      Soon as the sun sets we move. 

                                       59.

             MURPHY
	(CONT'D)
      If we can’t get comms from that top 
      we’re probably gonna have to walk 
      home anyway, so get some rest. Axe 
      you’re first security. We move in 
      about sixty minutes.


THIRTY MINUTES LATER.

Murphy, Danny, and Marcus. Hats low. Eyes closed. Danny on 
the glass.

It’s quiet. Sun getting low. Probably two hours of sunlight 
left.

ON AXE.

Calmly checking down hill, whistling very quietly to himself.

Tight on Luttrell resting.

Danny. Eyes closed. One arm around his radio.

Murphy. Eyes open. Staring up at the sky.

Back to Axe. Focused down range. 

Down the mountain. Something appears to move. Axe misses it. 
Hold a beat. More movement.

Just catches Axe’s peripheral... Axe shifts his gaze. 
Focusing. 

THEN

More movement. Axe sees it, raises his gun eye to the scope. 
Gently scanning the area of movement. 

Stops whistling.

AXE’S POV:

No movement.

Axe slowly pans his M-4 across the hill. Suddenly A FLASH OF 
SOMETHING HUMAN.

A HUMAN. He pans a bit more to the right. Then two more.

AXE pans way to the right. Almost as high as the SEALs are 
and he see’s more movement. 

They are almost surrounded.

TIGHT ON LUTTRELL eyes still closed.

                                       60.

             MURPHY
	(CONT'D)
        (oc)
      Sssst! Sssst!

Luttrell lifts up his hat and looks left.

Sees Axe, rigid, in firing position, his rifle aimed straight 
up the mountain.

             MURPHY
	(CONT'D)
        (to Danny)
      Try and call it in.

Danny desperate to get the radio to work.

Luttrell fixes his Mark 12 into firing position looks through 
scope down hill.

LUTTRELL’S POV.

Lined along the top are at least a dozen heavily armed 
Taliban warriors, each one of them with an AK pointing 
downward. Some carrying rocket propelled grenades.

LUTTRELL looks left.

More Taliban coming down hill to flank them.

Luttrell looks right.

More Taliban.

The SEALs are FUCKED.

             MURPHY
	(CONT'D)
      How the fuck fast are these little 
      bastards?

All four SEALs guns up.

Marcus in the middle, Axe and Danny up to his left. Murphy 
twenty feet off to his right. Marcus slowly belly crawls 
towards Murphy.

             MURPHY
	(CONT'D)
      What are you thinking?

             LUTTRELL
      I’m thinking that we’re about 
      fixing to get into a pretty good 
      gunfight.

             MURPHY
      Yea.

                                       61.

             LUTTRELL
      Looks like I voted wrong.

             MURPHY
      Negative. We’ve been given the 
      opportunity to reach out and make 
      some hell fucking strong contact 
      with our friends from the other 
      side. Job well done.

             LUTTRELL
      Hoo-yah to that sir.

ON DANNY AND AXE

Looking up the hill which is now swarming with Taliban. 
Dozens of soldiers flowing down hill flanking them. 

             DANNY
      Do they see us?

             AXE
      Dunno.

BACK TO MARCUS.

His back pressed up against a tree, inventorying his ammo.  
Grenades. Knife.

Danny, Axe, Murphy all doing the same. Readying for war.

Axe and Danny sneak quick looks at the pictures of their 
wives taped inside their helmets.  

The trap tightening around all of them.  All four focused up 
hill.

A TREE TWENTY FEET IN FRONT OF MARCUS.

A flash of a turban. Glint of an AK Barrel pointed in his 
general direction.

Luttrell tightens the grip of his rifle slowly starts 
pointing it in the direction of the man behind the tree.

Luttrell eyes on glass, still as marble. Aimed at the tree.

Marcus looks over his shoulder at Murphy whose gun is also 
trained on the tree. 

Marcus eyes back on the scope.

SCOPE POV:

                                       62.

A fierce-eyed Taliban warrior peering straight into the 
scope. Black eyes and thick black beard. The barrel of his AK 
pointed dead on Luttrell.
Hold. 

THEN.

Luttrell fires once. Blowing the man’s head off.

An odd brief moment of silence as the head shot Afghan 
stumbles, still standing, still clutching his AK-47. He takes 
three more steps towards Luttrell.

Stops.
Luttrell shoots again removes what’s left of the fighter’s 
head.
The Afghan starts to fall and as he hits the ground, all HELL 
BREAKS LOOSE.

From above and half way down both flanks the Taliban open 
fire. 
Screaming at each other, communicating through violent, loud 
bursts of Pashto, the Taliban moving fast down the hill. 
Agile and fearless, not weighted down with US-style gear, 
they are able to leap boulders, fallen trees.
Taraq in the middle of the pack on the top of the SEALs. UP 
TOP - Shah calmly giving orders into his radio comms.

ON MURPHY.

Taliban moving down the hill on both sides. Shooting as they 
move.

A solid line of at least fifty Taliban in firing positions on 
top of the hill above them.

The SEALs are close to being surrounded.

MURPHY checks his rear.

MURPHY POV

A cliff. More of a series of cliffs. Multiple death falls. 
First one is at least 300 feet.

Murphy calls it.

             MURPHY
      Push right flank.

Axe the farthest right starts shooting and moving right INTO 
the wall of the Taliban flanking his right.

Luttrell follows staying low, shooting, Danny firing with one 
arm. Desperate to get the radio up.

                                       63.

             DANNY
      Spartan 01 reporting major enemy 
      contact. We need help. Spartan 01 
      reporting major enemy contact. 
      Request immediate QRF! Spartan 01 
      requesting immediate QRF.

Murphy’s doing the same with his SAT phone. He’s moving right 
trying to dial up the TOC. Not getting through.

Danny’s left two fingers HIT. Dangling bloody and mangled.

He tries to put them back into his hand. Jams his ring finger 
back into its socket. His pinkie is beyond repair.

             DANNY
	(CONT’D)
      Marcus!

Luttrell turns, Danny holds up his fucked up hand.

             LUTTRELL
      Wrap it up bro.

             DANNY
      Roger that.

Taliban gunfire is picking up. Axe the deepest right kills 
two Taliban. Two more immediately fill their positions.

             MURPHY
      Danny did you get the call through?

             DANNY
      I made the call. Don’t know if it 
      went through. You?

             MURPHY
      I couldn’t get a line.

             DANNY
      Fuck.

Marcus is pushing right behind Axe trying to break the right 
Taliban flank.

Charging the Ambush.

                                       64.

             MURPHY
      Keep pushing right. Kill ‘em all.

The four SEALs fighting well as a team. Crawling, shooting 
and covering as they start making progress killing their way 
into the right side of the Taliban ambush.

The Taliban close enough to see clearly.

Axe shot through the left shoulder. Ignoring it he keeps 
firing. His long scope making him very accurate. As he shoots 
deep into the left flank.

TALIBAN POV:

From behind at least 12 Tabliban fighters pushing deeper into 
the right side.
Two more Taliban hit. The remaining start taking solid 
covering positions, firing down at the four SEALs.
Axe being the closest takes the majority of the firepower.
Decent cover from a granite boulder which is getting hacked 
to pieces by the incoming AK fire.
Razor sharp stone shrapnel chunks slicing into Axe’s face and 
neck. Blood runs down his face drips off his chin. 
Luttrell getting equally shot up. Returning fire. His cover 
rock getting shot up bad. Chunks of granite tearing into his 
face and neck. 
FURTHER to the left, Danny and Murphy shooting, trying to get 
closer to Luttrell and Axe.
Danny takes another round, blowing clear through his right 
thigh shattering his right femur. Blood, muscle chunks and 
bone tear through his pants.

             DANNY
      Goddammitt.

Pissed he keeps moving. Firing. Ignoring his two gunshots. 
Hand and Leg.
Danny moves up with Murphy behind some decent cover.

             MURPHY
      Can you fight?

             DANNY
      Roger that.

                                       65.

             MURPHY
      Want me to take the radio?

             DANNY
      Negative.

Murphy looks up towards Axe who is far right.

             MURPHY
        (yelling)
      AXE?!

             AXE
      Sir!

             MURPHY
      Can we break that flank?  Hold 
      this, we’re gonna push left! 

Axe gets shot through the top of his shoulder the bullet 
tearing down through his shoulder and burning deep inside his 
chest.
Axe keeps firing, hitting a Taliban in the knee. The Taliban 
fires back at Axe missing but sending sharp rock chips 
shearing up off the granite into Axe’s face. Shredding his 
right ear, cutting into his eyeballs.
Half blind. Watery out of focus images as sweat mixed with 
blood. Axe struggles to see. When his vision clears up enough 
to focus:
AXE POV.
Two Tali fighters. Moving fast out of cover, right at AXE. 
Directly at the Americans. SEAL style. Attacking the counter 
attack.
The Taliban are close to the half blind Axe. Axe fires blind. 
Misses. The Taliban almost on him. Then:
One of the Tali hit with a round from Luttrell, killed.  The 
other, wounded, falls on Axe.  Vicious hand-to-hand fight.
Luttrell runs up to help Axe.  Takes the remaining Taliban 
soldier out with a point-blank headshot. 
From the right, a BELT FED MACHINE GUN opens up on their 
position.

Marcus and Axe start moving left.  Both shot during the move - 
Marcus in his right butt-cheek, Axe in his right thigh.  


INT. TOC. BAGRAM

Comms guy at radio. Checking wall clock. See’s Kristensen, 
Shane, and some of the other Team 10 guys.  

             COMMS GUY
      Spartan 01 is about to miss a comms 
      second window.

                                       66.

             KRISTENSEN
      How long?

             COMMS GUY
      2 hours 15 minutes.

Tight on Kristensen. Thinking. Checking the clock. 

             KRISTENSEN
      Call me if they miss two. 

             COMMS GUY
      Roger that.

EXT. ON THE MOUNTAIN 

CHAOS.
A massive barrage of gunfire erupting from the right Taliban 
flank.

             AXE
      Right is no good.

Murphy looks left. He can see twenty Taliban moving into 
firing positions.

             MURPHY
      Fuck me.

The first RPG comes from the left side. Hitting just short of 
Danny and Murphy. Blasting them backwards. Covering them with 
dirt and rock.
Luttrell swings his gun left and starts firing into the left 
Taliban position.

             LUTTRELL
      Mikey?

             MURPHY
      Yea?

             LUTTRELL
      You ok?

             MURPHY
      We’re good.

A bullet slams in Murphy’s lower stomach.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      This is no good.

                                       67.

             LUTTRELL
      Roger that.

             MURPHY
      Can we break that right flank?

             LUTTRELL
      Negative. We got to go left.

             MURPHY
      Negative.

From downhill, two RPG’s fire at their position.

Dietz takes a shot in his upper-right chest.  
A massive double RPG explosion. Tears away chunks of granite. 
Shrapnel cutting deep into all four SEALs. They are now 
clearly under attack from all three sides.

             LUTTRELL
      We can take ‘em Mikey but I’m 
      thinking we’re gonna need a new 
      spot.

Tight on Murphy.

             MURPHY
      Roger that.

He turns behind him giving that 50 ft. cliff a second look.
The Taliban gunfire is relentless now. Coming from all three 
sides.
Luttrell, Danny and Axe returning constant fire. Reloading 
mags. Firing away. Marcus hit for the first time in his right 
ass cheek.
Tight on Murphy:

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      We gotta fall back.

Luttrell looks at the cliff behind them.

             LUTTRELL
      You mean fall off.

                                       68.

             MURPHY
      Roger that. Fall off. Danny can you 
      move?

             DANNY
      No problem.

             MURPHY
      Axe?

             AXE
      Good to go.

As the four shot up SEALs turn and start to move fast towards 
the edge of the cliff. The pitch causing them to run and 
start falling immediately. Danny’s legs giving out, buckling 
as he hurls himself up and over the ledge.
Marcus turns to Murphy.
Luttrell, Murphy and Axe do the same. For a second they look 
like four country boys cliff jumping into a lake. Except for 
the blood streaming from necks and guts and legs, the bullet 
tracers flying all around them... 
They fly off the cliff and it looks kind of beautiful. 
Freeing...until.

IMPACT. BOTTOM OF 1ST CLIFF
Bone crushing. Concussive. Violent beyond words. Human bodies 
smashing into rock. Tearing through trees. Bouncing. Broken 
bones and smashed faces. Helmets fly off. The SEALs crash and 
bounce and flip. Finally settling hard on a reasonably flat 
part of the cliff. 300 yards below. 
SILENCE. BOTTOM OF 1ST CLIFF
Tight on Luttrell. Face down. The first to move.
Face lifts. Nose clearly broken. Luttrell looks to his left.
Murphy struggling to his knees. Broken teeth. Face shredded. 
To the right, Danny and Axe.  

             MURPHY
      Hey Marcus.

             LUTTRELL
      Yes sir.

             MURPHY
      That sucked. 

             LUTTRELL
      Yes sir.

                                       69.

             MURPHY
      I mean that really sucked.

             LUTTRELL
      Yes sir.

Voices screaming up the mountain.
TOP OF 1ST CLIFF
Taraq is at the jump point looking down the steep cliff. 
Feels unsurvivable. Several fierce lieutenants flanking Shah. 

             SHAH
      Go. 

Dozens of Taliban start making their way down the steep 
cliff.

AT THE BOTTOM OF 1ST CLIFF
Murphy, Marcus Axe and Dietz struggling to their feet.

             MURPHY
      Fuck.

Luttrell sees the blood pouring from Murphy’s gut. 

             LUTTRELL
      Let me see it.

Pulling up Murphy’s shirt revealing a decent gut shot. Marcus 
looks for his med kit.

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
      Lost my med kit.

             MURPHY
      Where’s your gun?

Luttrell looks down. To his left, then right. Spots his gun 
ten feet away in the dirt. 

                                       70.

             LUTTRELL
      God’s looking out for us.

             MURPHY
      If this is looking out for us I 
      don’t want to see him pissed.

             LUTTRELL
      We’re doing good Mikey we just 
      gotta...

Luttrell interrupted by a series of severe incoming RPG’s. 
Blasting all around them. 
Luttrell and Murphy dive behind some fallen trees. Looking 
up.

             MURPHY
      We just got to get off this hill.

HALFWAY DOWN 1ST CLIFF.
Shah’s Taliban are slowly moving down the cliff. Not nearly 
as fast as the SEALs fall. But they are definitely coming.
ON LUTTRELL and MURPHY. LOG HIDE.
48F
Returning fire. Picking off a couple of Taliban but revealing 
their position. More incoming RPG’s tearing into the cover 
trees.
Trees start burning.
A metal hook - RPG debris - spears into Luttrell’s right 
side.
He keeps firing when from the left...
A LOUD CRASHING. 
Two bodies falling hard.
Axe and Danny. Falling hard like Murphy and Luttrell. 
Slamming, flipping, landing 50 ft to the right of the tree 
hide.
Axe shot up getting to his feet. The Taliban shooting down at 
him.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      Axe! Here! Move it buddy. Run!

Axe sees Murphy behind the trees. Charges to the hide.

                                       71.

             AXE
      This sucks.

No hesitation - Axe slams a fresh magazine into his M4 starts 
firing up the hill. Marcus is looking back to Danny.  
Danny is dead still. No movement.
Axe provides cover as Luttrell and Murphy, dodging RPG’s and 
a hailstorm of AK fire, grabbing an alive but seriously 
fucked up Danny.
Picking Danny up they start hauling him back to the tree for 
cover.
TIGHT on Danny as a Bullet slams through his right rib cage

             DANNY
        (eyes tight, through 
         mashed teeth)
      Goddamn this sucks.

Luttrell and Murphy slam into the tree hide propping Danny 
up.
The four SEALs back together ready to fight.  Marcus trying 
to treat Danny; pulling out his Burst Kit 
Danny recovering staring down at his blood-soaked hand, 
dazed, looks to Marcus

             DANNY
	(CONT’D)
      Marcus, I’m shot.

             LUTTRELL
      We are all shot bro, can you fight? 

Danny stares back down at his bleeding, mangled hand, then at 
his gun. 

             DANNY
        (muttering to himself)
      Mess up my drawing hand, that 
      pisses me off.

Danny raises his gun uphill, takes aim at a Taliban fighter 
jumping from rock to rock. Danny fires killing the Taliban. 
Re-aims, fires, kills a second. Re-aims, fires, kills a 
third. 

Looks to Marcus. 

             DANNY
	(CONT’D)
      I can fight. 


                                       72.

The SEALs now packed into a burning LOG HIDE fighting as best 
as they can from inferior position.
UP HILL.
Taliban starting to re-mass. Dialing in on the SEALs 
position.
Thirty AK-47’s firing down on the SEALs.
IN THE LOG HIDE.
48H
The SEALs getting sprayed. A ceiling of AK fire. The SEALs 
flat on their backs.
SEAL POV.
AK tracers streak over head.
MURPHY has his face next to Dietz.

             DANNY
	(CONT'D)
      I tried ‘em at least three times 
      boss.

             MURPHY
      Nothing?

             DANNY
      Nothing.

Murphy and Dietz both take rounds. Danny in the foot.
Three of Murphy’s right toes blow off. His boot leaking 
blood.
Murphy returning fire. Hot brass shell casings falling into 
his shirt.

             MURPHY
      Dammit!

Murphy getting the brass out of his shirt.

             MURPHY

             LUTTRELL
      Got to.

             MURPHY

Dietz is by far the worst. Trying to breath. Blood loss 
starting to weaken him. 
Murphy pulls out his sat phone, tries to get a signal.

refusing to go gently...His right hand fumbling for his flip 
knife in his front pocket. 
Taraq just stares at Danny’s broken mangled fingers trying to 
open his knife. Drops it.

around each side of the giant boulder.
TWENTY FEET to his left Murphy is doing the same.

while the other moves fast to a higher covering rock. 
This is a desperate, clawing uphill mountain scramble. Two 
men, like animals brutally determined to reclaim their fallen 
brother.
Tight on their hands, eyes, feet, sweat, blood and tears as 
they crawl their way, inch by inch back up this brutal rock 
mountain.

They are able to ascend about thirty feet before they run out

MURPHY and LUTTRELL side by side.
Bullets exploding all around them. 
Murphy’s got SAT phone out again trying to get a signal. He’s 
got no line of sight. Can’t make the call.

             MURPHY
      Yea.

             LUTTRELL
      Got to get to flat ground.

Tight on Murphy taking in the entire situation. Taliban all 
around them. His gun shots. Axe. Down hill fighting. Covering 
them.
Murphy studies the terrain. A jagged rock peak sticking out 
in the clear about fifty feet to his left.

             MURPHY
      I know.

             LUTTRELL
      We can’t get him Mikey.

             MURPHY
      We can get him.

             LUTTRELL
      We’re gonna die if we don’t get off 
      this mountain.

             MURPHY
      We’re gonna get him.

Murphy’s fixated on the exposed rock area fifty feet above 
him. 
He looks down hill to Axe. Desperately trying to keep the 
Taliban from getting at Luttrell and Murphy.

             MURPHY
	(CONT'D)
      I’m gonna get us some help Marcus.

             AXE
      Mike, they’re coming straight above 
      you and to your right. 

Murphy, SAT phone in hand, looks below to Marcus.

             MURPHY
      I’m gonna get this call out. 

             LUTTRELL
      Good luck on that one brother. 

             MURPHY
      Marcus, look at me.

Luttrell turns locks eyes with Murphy.

             MURPHY
	(CONT’D)
      I’m gonna make the call. 

Marcus looks past Murphy to the clear rock face above him. 
Luttrell gets what Murphy is saying, what he’s about to do. 

             LUTTRELL
      I’m sorry Mike.

             MURPHY
      For what bro?

Marcus takes a beat, looks away, then back at Murphy.

             LUTTRELL
      That we haven’t killed more of ‘em.

             MURPHY
      Oh we’re gonna kill more of them. 
      Bet on that Marcus. We’re gonna 
      kill a lot more of them. 

             LUTTRELL
      Roger that.

Murphy digs into his pack, has three remaining mags, hands 
them to Luttrell. Luttrell slides them into his vest. Murphy 
checks his M4, SAT phone in his left hand, M4 in his right.

                                       87.

He turns to Marcus, tears in both of their eyes. 

             MURPHY
      Never out of the fight Marcus.

             LUTTRELL
      Never.

Murphy turns, pushes up and simply stands. Completely 
exposed. He starts running uphill to the exposed rock, 
hitting send on the SAT phone. 

Luttrell and Axe lay down cover as Murph charges up the hill, 
taking repeated rounds. Legs, arms, guts, Murphy makes it to 
the clearing, the SAT connection locks in. Murphy sits on a 
rock oblivious to the incoming rounds.

It’s a suicide march...

Luttrell falls back to Axe as Murphy, multiple gun shots 
keeps firing.

Murphy slams his final magazine, blood pouring through his 
NYFD patch, running down both arms. Murphy raises his M4, one

slams through the front of Murphy’s face blowing him 
backwards, completely flipping him head over heels landing on

      I said let’s move!

Track with Kristensen on the Chinook up to the pilot.

The nightstalker pilot and Kristensen frantically confirming

             MUSSLEMEN
      What’s the fucking problem?

Hasslert charging toward Musslemen.

             HASSLERT
      You’re grounded.

             MUSSLEMEN
      What are you fucking talking about?

             HASSLERT
      You’re grounded, you have no Apache 
      support. Blackhawks can’t go in 
      without air cover. 

Musslemen looking around realizing the Apaches are not there. 

             MUSSLEMEN
      Where the fuck are the Apaches?

             HASSLERT
      We are trying to figure that out.

             MUSSLEMEN

Marcus scrambling back with Axe, jammed behind rocks, taking 
heavy, heavy fire. 

Marcus digs in side by side with Axe. Both men shot up, look

Luttrell doesn’t answer.

      Where up fucking top?

             LUTTRELL
      He’s getting the QRF.

The incoming gunfire stopping. An eerie silence coming over 
the hill. Just random Taliban voices. Calm. Distant. 

                                       92.

             AXE

             AXE
      Where exactly is Mikey?

             LUTTRELL
      I don’t know.

More tears pouring down Axe and Luttrell’s faces.

             LUTTRELL

      We gotta get down.

             AXE
      Did he make the call?

             LUTTRELL
      I don’t know....we got to get off

             AXE
      Do you think he made the call?

Axe and Marcus staring into each other.

EXT. AFGHAN SKIES


The two Chinook 47’s, hauling ass. Back ramp open, Kristensen 
standing over it. 

He looks ready to jump right now. Kristensen looks down at 
the steep mountains, back up to the following 47.

             KRISTENSEN

      What’s the problem? 

INTERCUT with Musslemen on the grounded Blackhawk in J-Bad. 

             MUSSLEMEN
        (radio)
      The Apaches were pulled.

             KRISTENSEN

      Why?

Kristensen moving up to the pilots of his 47. Plugs into the 
47 comms.

             KRISTENSEN
      What’s the deal with the Apaches? 
      The Blackhawks are grounded at J-
      Bad.

             PILOT
      Roger that. Blackhawks need the air 
      support. 

             KRISTENSEN
      They should have boots on ground 
      right the fuck now.

             PILOT
      Roger that.

             KRISTENSEN
      What the fuck is the problem?

             PILOT
      Not enough air assets in theatre, 
      that’s the fucking problem. 

             KRISTENSEN
      What’s our fucking ETA? 

             PILOT
      15 minutes.

             KRISTENSEN
      Where are the Apaches? 

             PILOT
      25 minutes.

             KRISTENSEN
      Can you put us down without the 
      Apaches?

                                       94.

             PILOT
      Not supposed to.

             KRISTENSEN
      Will you put us down?

Pilot pauses...looks to Kristensen.

             PILOT
      We’ll do whatever we have to do to 
      get you with your men.

             KRISTENSEN
      Thank you. 

EXT. ON GROUND


Luttrell and Axe trying to quietly climb their way down the 
mountain. Still a couple of hundred feet above the village. 

They are climbing, falling 10-20 ft. falls.

UP MOUNTAIN:


Taraq tracking them.  Shah, higher up communicating on radio.


EXT. HINDU KUSH SKY


The two 47’s. The 2nd 47 flies past Kristensen, taking the 
lead. 

             PILOTS
        (misc comms)
      1st 47 will fly over LZ make sure 
      it’s clear. Kristensen’s 47 will be 
      1st to hover.



EXT. J-BAD AIRBASE


The two Apaches show up. Tearing over the airfield. Hellfire 
missile arrays and 40 mm front mounted getting guns. 

                                       95.

The Blackhawks finally take off following the Apaches.


EXT. ON MOUNTAIN 



Tracking tight with Taraq. His worn sandaled feet slowly 
stepping down the mountain. He’s following blood drops.

Tight on beaded stone necklace with seven American Dog Tags 
hanging from it like human scalps.

Tight on a blood soaked dog tag:

“Danny Dietz”

We move across the faces of several of these Afghan warriors 
They feel more like Comanche Indians than anything else. 

Fierce and focused, guns up, they hunt Americans. 


FURTHER DOWN: 3RD CLIFF EDGE ABOVE VILLAGE


Luttrell and Axe at a major cliff edge, looking back 
up...guns pointed up mountain. 

We pull wide and see just how close Taraq now is to Luttrell 
and Axe, 100 ft. away, max. Closing in.

On Luttrell - hearing Taraq and his men, whispering to Axe. 

             LUTTRELL
      Come here Axe. Let me see you.

Axe nods,  blood slow running from his head shot down the 
back of the neck. Axe touches the wound.

             AXE
      Did they really shoot me in the 
      head?

             LUTTRELL
      Yea buddy.

A moment of silence.

             AXE
      It’s funny man. I thought it would 
      feel worse you know.

             LUTTRELL
      Yea.

                                       96.

             AXE
      Mikey and Danny are really dead 
      right?

             LUTTRELL
      Yea.

             AXE
      Are we dead?

             LUTTRELL
      Negative.

             AXE
      We’re fucking good right?

Axe stares at Luttrell. Marcus looks at his dying friend.

             AXE
	(CONT’D)
      Marcus?

             LUTTRELL
      We’re real good Axe. Real good. 
      Mikey made the call. We just got to 
      stay alive for fifteen minutes max.

             AXE
      Mikey made the call right?

             LUTTRELL
      Fuck yea he did.

             AXE
      They’re coming.

             LUTTRELL
      Coming strong man.

             AXE
      Good. That’s good.

             LUTTRELL
      I don’t want em to get us with an 
      RPG, Axe. 

             AXE
      If I fucking die you make sure 
      Cindy knows how much I love her. 

             LUTTRELL
      She knows.

                                       97.

             AXE
      You tell her I died with my 
      brothers. With a fucking full 
      heart.

             LUTTRELL
      We ain’t dying Axe.

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
      Can you get to that rock over 
      there?

Axe looks behind him.

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
      With the dead black tree?

             AXE
      Yea I can do that.

             LUTTRELL
      You get there. I’m gonna move 
      right. Cover each other.

             AXE
      Did Mikey make the call?

             LUTTRELL
      Fifteen minutes brother. Stay 
      strong Axe.

             AXE
      I’ll do it.

             LUTTRELL
      Stay quiet.

A nod from Axe and the two men split up.

Axe moves to his left, Luttrell to his right. 
Tight on Axe. Shot up. Blood pouring from head wound. Tough. 
Grinding it out. Staying low. Deep breathing. Grunting as he 
crosses the mountain. 
Gun fire erupts around him. Turning, spots half a dozen 
Taliban on him.
Axe pushes deeper into the woods. A hunted animal running out 
of options.
LUTTRELL
The same. Moving quiet in the other direction.

                                       98.

This is all very silent. Tense....Taraq like a hunting dog, 
dead quiet, Luttrell and Axe, the hunted, desperately trying 
to stay quiet. 

On Luttrell - trying to move towards a large rock...

His right foot digging in for traction, dislodges a small 
pebble... on that pebble picking up momentum, hitting smaller 
pebbles, dislodging more little rocks... A mini avalanche, 
hitting a bigger rock.

Tight on Luttrell.

Looking down at the small rock slide, hearing its noise....

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
      Shit.

And they open fire again, bullets firing all around Luttrell, 
both Luttrell and Axe return fire. This is much closer gun 
fighting...grenades and RPG’s at close quarters. Men behind 
rocks, guns blazing. 

INT. LEAD 47 - AIRBORNE 


Over the head of the lead pilot as he comes flying up towards 
the mountain.

ON LUTTRELL: MOUNTAIN ABOVE VILLAGE


Mid gunfight he looks up as that big 47 flies up high over 
them, over the top of the mountain.

On Axe and Luttrell spotting the QRF.

             LUTTRELL
      Keep fighting Axe.

Axe is fighting. Shot up but recharged by the 47. 

INT. LEAD 47


Too high to see the gunfight down below the pilot is focusing 
on the landing area on top of the mountain. He does a 1st fly 
by over the top. Looks clear.

             LEAD 47 PILOT
        (on radio)
      Looks good. Looks quiet.

                                       99.

             2ND 47 PILOT
      Roger that we’re good to drop. 

The second 47 pulls up over the LZ.

Ramp down, fast rope out. The SEALs, lead by Kristensen, up 
ready to fast rope out....

The TF 160 gunners alert, scanning behind their 50 Cal. 
Machine guns.

The 47 pulls up, high hover, 80 ft. drop. 

Tight on Kristensen

His hands around the fast rope....

             KRISTENSEN
      Let’s do this. Patton, you’re first 
      move!

Shane Patton, can’t help but grin, he’s on his feet moving 
towards the open door.

             KRISTENSEN
	(CONT’D)
      You good?

             SHANE PATTON
      Couldn’t be more good.

             KRISTENSEN
      Glorious opportunity here, Mr. 
      Patton.  

             SHANE PATTON
      Yes sir.  

Kristensen has one foot out of the chopper when... 

Movement on the ground. 

50 Cal gunner catches the reflection of something metallic, a 
small detonation from the ground. Then terrifying sights of 
incoming ordinance. 

             50 CAL GUNNER
      RPG!

Tight on Kristensen and Patton looking down as the RPG round 
flies into the chopper right past them, literally into the 
47. 


EXT. A MOMENT OF SILENCE, THEN...

The Chinook explodes.


Ripping apart, tilting, rotor blades immediately tearing into 
treetops then thick tree trunks - like massive buzz saws - 
the chopper turns and burns.

                                      100.

Rocks and trees churn, bodies break and burn and die as the 
big Chinook 47 rips apart exploding and tumbling down the 
mountain. 

DOWN RANGE:


ON LUTTRELL - peering up at the explosion. 

Luttrell watches wide-eyed as his teammates smash and burn.

Banks hard as the Taliban fire more RPG’s and small arms fire 
up at it-

ON THE FIRST 47:


INT. 47 - AIRBORNE 


Argument breaking out between SEAL Lt. and Airforce Pilot.

             SEAL LT.
      You got to put us down now!

             PILOT
      No fucking way.

             SEAL LT.
      Now!



As the SEALs on the chopper start breaking out the windows 
firing their M-4’s out the window, Airforce gunmen open up 
the 50 cals. Massive fire power blasting out from the 
choppers.



MOUNTAIN ABOVE VILLAGE - LATE DAY
Marcus looking cross mountain at Axe who has managed to 
transverse one hundred feet of the mountain and is leading a 
small pack of Shah’s men away from Luttrell.
Axe starts taking heavy fire. Shot twice through the throat. 
Falling backwards. Trying to get up. Back to his weapon.
AXE DYING.
Marcus watching helpless from across the mountain. Trying to 
cover Axe as the Taliban move in on him.
Not all of them have followed Axe because as Marcus turns 
back an RPG blows ten feet in front of him. Shrapnel and rock 
smashing into the side of his head. 
His Helmet tears off his head.

                                      101.

Tight on Marcus rolling backwards. Falling. Tumbling further 
down the mountain. 
Tight on his helmet, Texas flag painted bold across it. 
Rolling and smashing down the mountain.
He comes to a hard stop slamming the back of his exposed head  
into a rock.
Tight on Marcus. Close to unconscious. Very dazed, Very 
confused.
MARCUS POV.
Distorted visuals. Triple vision. No sound except emerging 
high pitched ringing. Marcus is deaf. 
He stares up at this apoplectic mountain in dazed wonder.

                                       77

The SEAL Lt. screaming at the Airforce Pilot.



             SEAL LT.
      Open the ramp.

             PILOT
      Negative. 

             SEAL LT.
      Open the goddamned ramp.

The Lt. has to be restrained, physically pulled back by two 
SEALs. Everyone screaming at each other.

Co-Pilot on radio putting out distress signal calling in the 
downed 47 to Bagram.

             CO PILOT
      We have a downed 47, repeat a 
      downed 47.


INT. BAGRAM - CJSOTF


This is the big command center. Not just SEALs, everybody- 
Army, Navy, Airforce, Marines. 

                                      102.

Shots of a massive response mobilization.
AWACS, C-130s, Choppers filling with Delta, Green Berets, DEV 
Group. 

Aircraft taking off. F18 fighter jets vectoring towards 
downed chopper.

EXT. LOWER MOUNTAIN

Marcus, hearing utterly fucked....getting closer to the

mountain top.

                                      103.



ON THE MOUNTAIN:

Taraq and his men hear the incoming Apaches.
Shah orders his men to take cover. The Taliban quickly 
becoming invisible from the sky.
DOWN HILL:
83B
Marcus deaf to the incoming Apaches. Has no idea how close 
they are. As he falls, gets up, off balance stumbles off a 30 
ft drop.
This time not so lucky with his landing, comes down hard, 
shatters his right shin, bone tears through his skin, 
compound fracture.
Screaming in pain, Luttrell crawls into a rock crevasse. 
Hiding, he attempts to clear his head.
We play all of Luttrell’s audio perspective here as deaf. 
Abstract surges of sound. He’s basically deaf.
The Apaches fly high over head. Missing Luttrell. 
Disappearing over mountain tops as they keep moving to avoid 
enemy ground fire.
Struggling to silence his hysterical breathing, Luttrell 
hides as Taraq and his men move all around him. Luttrell sees 
shadows of the fighters. He silently starts covering himself 
with rocks and dirt.
Luttrell well hidden. 
We slowly push in on him as his head starts to nod forward. 
He lifts it. Fighting the powerful urge for sleep. It falls 
again. He lifts it. Leaning his head back against the 
crevasse wall.
Taraq and his men back on the hunt. Searching rock to rock.
Tight on Luttrell. Head back. Breathing slower. As Luttrell 
falls to sleep.
FADE TO BLACK.

SILENT.
OVER BLACK



                                      104.



The faint singing of morning birds. 

Growing louder.
SLOW FADE UP.
WIDE
Looking out at entire Hindu Kush Mountain range as the sun 
slowly rises behind the tallest peak.
STUNNING SUNRISE.


INT. LUTTRELL’S HIDE

TIGHT ON MARCUS. Looks DEAD. 

EYES TWITCH. SLOWLY OPEN.
LUTTRELL wakes up. 
Disoriented. First thing he notices is the bird sitting up on 
a rock above him. He hears it. Sort of. Faded. Loud then 
silent. His hearing has partially returned.
LUTTRELL very slowly clears himself from the dirt and rock 
hide.
Inventories himself, his weapons. 
Two magazines, two grenades. No food. No water.
Bleeding has stopped from his gunshot. Leg is fucked up. Shin 
bone busting out.
Luttrell sits down. Examining his leg. Probing the bone. Rips 
off his pants exposing his broken leg in UA shorts.  Tears 
welling he bites down on his lips as he resets the broken 
bone. Jamming it back inside his skin.
Tucking back the bone. 
Luttrell packs the puncture wound with dirt. Starts massaging 
his dead legs. Forcing blood back into them. Deep powerful 
breathing as he starts to will his body back into life.


                                      105.

EXT. LUTTRELL’S HIDE

Luttrell slowly moves out of the hide scanning the area for 
any sign of Taraq or Shah.
Luttrell sees nothing. 
The village is close. Couple of hundred yards.
LUTTRELL moves out. Slowly picking his way down towards the 
village.
At fifty yards Luttrell pulls up. Takes cover behind some 
rocks. Stares down at the village through his M4 scope.
LUTTRELL’S POV
Early morning. Women light fires. 
Buckets of water.
Tight on Luttrell’s blistered, cracked bone dry lips as he 
stares through his scope at the water.
We can feel his desperate thirst.
He stares at the water. Then voices pull his scope left.
LUTTRELL’s POV.
The two goat boys moving through the village.
Tight on Luttrell. 

             LUTTRELL
        (whispering)
      Motherfuckers.

He’s got the kids in his scope. Dead to rights. 
Luttrell’s finger on the trigger. 
The older teenage goat herder’s face fills his scope...
Then more voices.
Luttrell pans right.

TALIBAN 

Five men. 
Armed. 

                                      106.

Moving through the village. Passing the boys.
Tight on Marcus.
His finger slowly off the trigger.
Luttrell lowers his weapon. Looks to his left.
LUTTRELL’S POV.
A faint dirt trail below him leading away from the village.
Slowly and silently Luttrell moves out towards that trail.
Away from the village.
TRACKING with Luttrell. Slow going. He starts to put distance 
between himself and the village.

The recovery of the dead chopper team and speculation over 
the fate of the four man recon team.

             ARMY INTEL GUY
      We can confirm that there are no 
      survivors from the 47 and we think 
      we have recovered the bodies of 
      Murphy and Dietz.

Army Captains stare in furious silence.

      Axelson and Luttrell still 
      unaccounted for.

Unarmed predator drones circling the area. As Special Ops 
move in and secure the area around the downed chopper.

                                      107.


                                      108.

EXT. WOODS

Luttrell hobbles and falls and crawls through the woods.
Falling, getting up. Refusing to stop. 
A desperate search for water.

In the WOODS.
Tracking with Luttrell.
He’s running out of gas. 
Falling, crawling...grinding it out.
He falls. On his hands and knees. Stops, head down. 
Hears something. Lifts his head. Looks off to his left.
A WOLF.
Male, large and powerful.
The wolf studies Luttrell.
Luttrell studies the wolf.

                                      109.

No menace just mutual curiosity.
Luttrell picks himself up.
Studies the wolf closely.
Water drips off the side of the Wolf’s face.
His coat seems wet.
Luttrell turns. Listens.
HEARS the SOUND of falling water.
TRACK with Luttrell towards the sound of the water.
Luttrell moves to 20 ft. waterfall, pouring into a beautiful 
clear pool of crystal clear fresh water.
Luttrell tries to slide down the steep cliff sides of the 
water pool.
Too excited, moving too fast, Luttrell slips, falling, 
tumbling. He falls fast into the water.

UNDERWATER.

Luttrell cuts through the water. Like a baptism as the cool 
water surrounds him. Luttrell stays under water. Eyes closed. 
Feeling it.
Finally comes up. 
SURFACES.
Swims to the shore on his hands and knees. 
LUTTRELL drinks. And drinks......
Slurping like a broken animal.
Grabbing for hunks of water plants. Luttrell eats. Shoving 
the plants into his mouth. Desperate for any kind of energy.

TIGHT on LUTTRELL.
Slowly freezes. Senses something.
Slowly looks up.
LUTTRELL’S POV:
Three Afghan men. One man we recognize as Gulab.

                                      110.

A young Afghan boy.
NOT Taraq’s crew.
Three different men.
One holds a machete. Staring down at this broken SEAL.
Luttrell stares back at these men.
A moment of silence. Then.
Luttrell reaches for a grenade.
Pulls the pin.
Holds the armed grenade.
The Afghan men appear non pulsed.

             LUTTRELL
      Stay back.

The men just stare with curiosity.
Luttrell holds up his grenade.

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
      I don’t care. You understand? I 
      don’t care. I will kill us all.

Finally one of the Afghans. A 30 year old male GULAB, the 
leader, strong rugged handsome, steps forward. Hands up in 
peace.

             GULAB
      Not Taliban.

Luttrell studies Gulab. Looks deep into his eyes.
Luttrell looks from Gulab to the other Afghan men. Their 
faces seem kind. Nothing like the death looks we have seen 
from the Taliban.

             GULAB
	(CONT’D)
      Come.

Gulab slowly stepping to and reaching for Luttrell.
Voices heard from deeper into the woods.
Taraq and his crew getting closer.
One of Gulab’s men says something quiet to Gulab.

                                      111.

Gulab reaches his hand out to Luttrell...
Luttrell looks deep into Gulab’s eyes.
Armed grenade in one hand, Luttrell slowly reaches his right 
bleeding hand out.
Tight on two hands grabbing each other.
As they pull him up, out of the stream, voices of Taraq and 
his men suddenly much closer.

Gulab whispers something to one of his men.

Luttrell is quickly pushed down into a crevasse between two 
rocks.

A young Afghan boy sits on top of Luttrell hiding him 
further.

Luttrell eyes wide, clutching his grenade.

The young boy gently patting Luttrell’s back, trying to calm 
him.

             YOUNG BOY
        (whispering)
      Shuuuu....shuuuuu

As Taraq with three Taliban fighters crest the cliff looking 
down at the pond.

At Gulab and his three men. A young boy sitting on a rock.

A stare off as the armed Taliban look down at the unarmed 
Gulab and his Villagers.

	       TARAQ
	(not particularly 
	friendly)
	From what Village are you?

		TARAQ 
	Da kom kali yee?

	       GULAB
	Peace be with you my brother 
	we are from Kandish.

		GULAB
	Pa khair zma wrora, mong da

       		TARAQ
	And are you in Kandish true 
	believers and correct in your 
	thinking?

		GULAB
	Aw baley zamaa rora.

                                      112.

	       TARAQ
	And have you or any of your 
	brothers seen the Americans 
	moving through these woods?

		TARAQ
	Aya ta ya sta wronoo

                GULAB
        Tasey yawazaney khalk ye che 
        mong waledaley.

		GULAB
	You are the only people we 
	have seen.
	Taraq studies Gulab. 
	Looks closely.

		TARAQ’s POV
	Luttrell’s blood on his right hand. A drop drips into the 
	water.

                TARAQ
        Aya sta lass Khog dey?

       		TARAQ
	Is something wrong with your 
	hand?
	Gulab holds Taraq’s gaze. Doesn’t look at the blood.

		GULAB
        Dosta, Monga tola wraz waney 
        ghosawoo, Zyatara wakht zmong 
	lawsoona weeney kege.

                GULAB
	We have been cutting trees 
	all day my friend. Usually 
	there is much more blood.

In the CREVASSE.

Luttrell is freaking out. Hyperventilating.

The young boy keeps gently patting his back.
Taraq studies Gulab on more beat.
	       TARAQ
	If you see the Americans. 
	Tell us or we will take your 
	heads.

		TARAQ
	Ka taso americayan woledel. 
	Mong ta malomat rakey ao ka 
	na mong ba staso sarona ghos 
        kro.

	       GULAB
	I understand.

		GULAB
	Za pohegam.


	       TARAQ
	Peace be with you my brother.

		TARAQ
	Zma wrora Allah de pa man ke 
        lara.

	       GULAB
	And may peace be with you as 
	well my brother.

		GULAB
	Allah de ta hum pa aman ke 
	lare.


Taraq and his men take off. Hold on Gulab and his men a 
couple of beats.

                                      113.

Gulab signals to one man who quickly and silently moves up 
the little cliff. 

Signals that it is clear.

Gulab quickly moves to a very confused Luttrell, pulling him 
out of the crevasse.

             LUTTRELL
      Why are you helping me?

             GULAB
      No Taliban.

On Luttrell as the Afghans quickly move him into the woods, 
The little Afghan boy continues patting Luttrell’s leg for 
comfort.


INT. BAGRAM AIR BASE. CJSOTF

Frantic activity as rescue teams are tracked. SEALs, Rangers, 
Green Berets, Marines. Small tracking teams inserted all 
throughout the area. Each assigned to different villages. 
Tight on a map as we see the KANDISH village.

EXT. GULAB’S VILLAGE


Luttrell with Gulab and the Afghans being led into the small 
village. He’s walking weak with an arm on Gulab’s shoulder, 
the grenade still tight in right hand.

Luttrell’s POV:

The Village. Men women, children, animals all staring at this 
Giant broken American. An alien entering their world. 

Marcus staring back in equal confusion. Locking eyes with a 
90 year old woman. 

The young boy by his side points to the woman. Has a 
conversation with her. Pointing to Marcus’s Texas leg.


INT. GULAB’S HOUSE


Luttrell laid down on a mattress.

             GULAB
      We get Americans for you.


                                      114.

             LUTTRELL
      Do you know where to find the 
      Americans?

             GULAB
      Yes, we know.

             LUTTRELL
      Pen? Paper? Please.

A pen and note paper are produced. Luttrell scribbles a note. 
Identifying himself, asking for assistance. 
Gulab takes the note, gives it to his father, a fifty-eight-
year-old Afghan mountain man, strong muscle.
The trekker pockets the note, heads out of the village, 
disappears up into the mountain. 


Stay with Luttrell and Gulab. Luttrell looks from Gulab to 
the little boy, slowly puts pin back in grenade. Then from 
outside, loud voices ARGUING.

Track with Gulab outside to the edge of the village.
Taraq with five men. He looks pissed.

	       TARAQ
	We want the American.

	       GULAB
	Please leave our village.

		TARAQ
	Mong Americaye ghawaro.

               GULAB
        Mehrabani okey zamonga kali 
        perigadey

       		TARAQ
	This village has supported 
	the Americans.

       		GULAB
	We want no trouble with you, 
	please leave.

		TARAQ
	Da dey kali  khalgo 
	Americayano sara marasta kari 
        da.

		GULAB
	Mong taso sara hes moshkel na 
	ghawaro, mehrabani/lutfan da 
        dey zaya larr shey.

Taraq studies Gulab a beat, then without warning smashes him 
in the side of the face. Gulab takes a knee. Looks up.

Taraq hits him again.

Pure humiliation.

Tight on Gulab, tears water, as he summons his courage and 
stands tall, defiant, eyes blazing back at Taraq. 



INT. LUTTRELL’S ROOM


Luttrell’s room as Taraq and his men come smashing through 
the door.

                                      115.

Luttrell weak, tries to get up, is smashed down to the floor 
by Taraq. 

Luttrell tries to fight back. He is too weak, he is kicked 
and pounded viscously by Taraq and his men. Grenade just out 
of reach. 

Luttrell is flipped on his back. Arms and legs held down as 
Taraq gets on top of him, knife out.
             TARAQ
      What base are you from?
Luttrell’s head held back, neck exposed, Taraq moves in with 
the blade. 

             TARAQ
	(CONT’D)
      What unit are you from?

When the door is kicked open.
Gulab AK-47 aimed at Taraq, two armed villagers behind him. 
From the windows, an old man with a shotgun. Screaming and 
chaos. Eight armed Afghans in a small room. Screaming at each 
other. Guns up. 
Taraq freezes. Out the window he sees five more of Gulab’s 
villagers - guns up.



       		GULAB
	Enough.

Taraq slowly stands.

		GULAB
	bas.


	       TARAQ
	You are making a mistake.

	       GULAB
	You will not harm this man in 
	my home.

	       TARAQ
	Then let us take him.

	       GULAB
	He is my guest. You will 
	leave our village.

		TARAQ 
	Tasey ghalatey kawey.

                GULAB
        Ta ba zama pa koor ki dey

                                      116.

               TARAQ 
       Mong ba bia razo.

		TARAQ
	We will come back.

	       GULAB
	Then you will fight my entire 
	tribe.

A tense stand off, Taraq staring at Gulab. He and his men 
slowly release Luttrell...move out past Gulab.

               GULAB
       Bya ba zma tola qabila staey 
       khilaf jange kawe. 

	       TARAQ
	For an American you will all 
	die. Do you understand that? 

		TARAQ
	Da yao Americayee da para ba 
	taso toll mrey. Aya taso 
        powhegey 

	       GULAB
	Stay away from this village.

		GULAB
	Da dey kali na larey osey.

They stare inches apart. Taraq smiles, orders his men out.

Taraq stops, turns back, faces the entire village.

              TARAQ
        Taso tolo khapal fareeq aw 
        khawakha malooma kra, da dey

	Tasey tol.

		TARAQ
	You have all made your 
	choice, you have declared 
	your side and for this all 
	men, women, children will be 
	slaughtered. All of you.

Tight on Gulab trembling trying his best to show no fear.
Tight shots of Gulab’s villagers; farmers with guns, all of 
them trembling. 

EXT. MOUNTAINS 


The old men with the note from Luttrell treks hard and fast 
over the mountains. 

EXT. WOODS - OUTSIDE VILLAGE 


Taraq on cell phone as he climbs up a small hill overlooking 
Gulab’s village.  

Taraq’s calling in more men, waiting.


EXT. GULAB’S VILLAGE


Gulab and three of his tribesmen having a heated 
conversation, argument over Luttrell. Feels similar to the 
SEALs debating the ROE on the mountain top.

Women in packs watch from a distance.


INT. GULAB’S HOUSE

The little boy squatting on floor next to Luttrell, won’t 
take his eyes off him.
An odd staring contest.


                                      117.

             MARCUS
      What’s your name?

The boy just stares.

             MARCUS
	(CONT’D)
      Name?

Nothing.
Luttrell looks down at his gunshot wounds, still seeping 
blood. He looks to the young boy.

             LUTTRELL
      Knife.

             LITTLE BOY
      Knife.

             LUTTRELL
      Go get knife.
      Hey.

The boy looks at Luttrell.

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
      Come. Come.

Luttrell gestures for the boy to come over. 

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
      Knife.

The boy is confused. Just stares at Luttrell.

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
      Knife.

Luttrell finds a little piece of wood on the cave floor, 
picks it up. Makes a cutting move with it.

                                      118.


EXT. WOODS - OUTSIDE VILLAGE


Shah, with five more heavily armed Taliban, join Taraq in the 
woods. Brief conversation in Arabic -- Taraq briefs Shah on 
situation.  Now ten in total, they stare down at Gulab’s 
village.

INT. GULAB’S HOUSE


The little boy has brought back a small live duck. Presents 
it to Luttrell.

             LUTTRELL
        (confused)
      What is that?

The kid silently holds the duck out to Luttrell.

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
      I said knife.

             LITTLE BOY
      Knife.

             LUTTRELL
      That’s not a knife.

             LITTLE BOY
      Not a knife.

             LUTTRELL
      That’s a fucking duck.

             LITTLE BOY
      That’s a fucking duck.

             LUTTRELL
      I need a knife!

             LITTLE BOY
      Knife!

             LUTTRELL
      For my leg!

             LITTLE BOY
      For my leg!

Gulab enters looking down at Luttrell.

             LUTTRELL
      Please. I need a knife.

                                      119.

Gulab staring down at Luttrell. Moves to the back of the 
house, comes back with a large knife.

Gruesome bullet removing sequence. Blood. Screaming digging 
scraping out bullets and shrapnel from Luttrell’s back and 
legs. Gulab digs with a knife. Pours water on the wounds. The 
little boy holds Luttrell’s hands and whispers to him.

Luttrell passes out.

EXT. HINDU KUSH - NIGHT

Under the full moon the trekker moves across a mountain top.

Gulab and his villagers stand watch over their village. 

Luttrell sleeps. His fever burning.

SUNRISE

EXT. HILLS ABOVE GULAB’S VILLAGE


Taraq and Shah, now with fifty men. Heavily armed. AKS and 
RPGS,  Shah gives orders. The men break into three groups. 
Moving out to flank the village.

Gulab’s villagers still on watch. The town feels locked down 
like an old western.

INT. GULAB’S HOUSE

Luttrell wakes. A small fire. Gulab and the little boy 
staring at Luttrell.

Luttrell struggles to sit up.

Gulab hands him water. Luttrell drinks in massive gulps. 
Choking.

Gulab takes water bottle from Marcus. 

             GULAB
        (arabic)
      Slow.

Gulab hands Luttrell a bowl of cooked Lamb.

Luttrell starts inhaling the meat. Fist fulls. As he starts 
choking.

             GULAB
	(CONT’D)
        (arabic)
      Slow.

Luttrell nods. Trying to slow down. Trying to show a 
semblance of control.

Gulab points to the Texas flag on Marcus’s vest. 

             GULAB
	(CONT’D)
      America?

             MARCUS
      Texas.

      Yes.

      Tex.

             MARCUS

             LITTLE BOY
      Texas.

Luttrell eyes the water bottle. 

             LUTTRELL
      More water. Please.

Gulab hands Marcus the bottle. Again he starts drinking in 
desperate, choking gulps. The little boy laughing at 
Luttrell’s ravenous thirst. Gulab a small smile.

The little boy and Gulab just stare. As Luttrell finishes all 
the meat and drinks all the water.

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
      I don’t know why your doing this 
      for me. 

Gulab and the little boy staring at Marcus.

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
      Thank you.

The two men staring at each other as an incoming RPG slams 
into the house. Huge explosion. 

Frantic screaming from outside. Gulab up and out first. 
Luttrell struggles to stand. The little boy moving to 
Luttrell helping him up. Luttrell grabbing his vest and gun 
moving out just as a 2nd RPG detonates destroying the rest of 
Gulab’s house.


EXT. VILLAGE

TARAQ attacks with his men.

Brutal fight. Hand to hand, gun on gun. Gulab shot, Marcus 
shot again. The Taliban is about to kill Marcus when the 
little boy calls out to Marcus. 

                                      122.

The Taliban is on top of Luttrell, choking him, killing him. 
Luttrell’s hands clawing at the man, digging into earth, 
grasping for wood, a stone, anything...when...a KNIFE, is 
slapped into Luttrell’s hand. Luttrell looks up, the little 
boy. Staring at Luttrell. 

Marcus buries the knife into the neck of the fighter. 

Rolling out as the building in front of them detonates. Heavy 
machine gunfire tearing it up. Luttrell and Shah fall back. A 
woman charges out grabbing the little boy. Eye contact with 
Luttrell as he is carried away.

Gulab and Marcus pinned down...Taraq moving in.

Taraq is about to win.

When off camera, Luttrell looking up at the empty sky, he 
hears something.

THUMP THUMP THUMP

Silent. Then.

Giant explosions all around Luttrell. Taliban blowing up as 
if HAND of GOD was attacking.

INT. AC-130


We see gunners targeting. The 40mm firing with extreme 
precision.

Luttrell looks up behind him.

Two American Apaches, flanking two Blackhawks.

Gulab fires first.

On Taraq, running towards us full frame as...

Gulab’s bullet slams into the side of Taraq...spinning him 
around as...Luttrell’s bullet takes his head off...Taraq 
falling slow and hard. Dead. 

Tight on Luttrell and Gulab.

Apaches circling over head as two Blackhawks land behind 
them.

Air Force Search and Rescue Helicopter airmen charge out of 
the chopper towards Luttrell.

             CREW CHIEF 
      Luttrell?

             LUTTRELL
      Yes sir.

             CREW CHIEF 
      It’s time to go home. 

The Airmen reach for Luttrell. Luttrell won’t let go of 
Gulab.    They hold each other like life long brothers.
The US Airmen separate Marcus from Gulab.  Marcus is too weak 
to resist.  

INT. CHOPPER

Luttrell loaded in the chopper, looks back at Gulab, reaches 
for him.  

Gulab takes his hand.

             LUTTRELL
      He comes with me.

Luttrell’s hand is gently separated from Gulab as Green 
Berets move into the village.  Gulab steps back as the 
chopper takes off.  

Tight on Luttrell, weak eyes open, glassed up.


             LUTTRELL

      There is a randomness to life. A 
      luck, a rhythm that is beyond my 
      ability to understand.

INT. CHOPPPER 

                                      124.

Flying fast over the Afghan mountains.

Luttrell beaten and broken, but clear-eyed...

Staring down at the vast epic Afghan mountain range.

             LUTTRELL
      Brave men have fought and died 
      building the proud tradition and 
      fear of reputation that I am bound 
      to uphold.

The mighty Hindu Kush...

As the sun sets...

Back to opening. Doctor’s working franticly to save Luttrell.

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
      I died up on that mountain. There’s 
      no question a part of me will 
      forever be up on that mountain dead 
      as my brothers died.

Close on heart monitor.

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
      But, there is a part of me that 
      lived. Because of my brothers, 
      because of them, I am still alive, 
      and I can never forget that no 
      matter how much it hurts, how dark 
      it gets, how far you fall... 

From flatline to a heartbeat.

             LUTTRELL
	(CONT’D)
      You are never out of the fight.

LONE SURVIVOR.
