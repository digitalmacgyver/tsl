INT. TOYOTA PRIUS-DAY

                                      2.


Its a bright, clear Los Angeles Saturday afternoon. Celeste 
and Jesse, now 30, both sing along to Love Rhino, the song 
heard under the montage. Jesse drives while Celeste is on her 
Blackberry. Jesse, boyishly handsome, wears an old tee and a 
hooded sweatshirt.  Celeste is wearing all black workout 
gear. She is always wearing all black.

             JESSE
      Im a Love Rhino...

	      CELESTE
	Dont worry bout me, Ive 
	got a enough love for 
	the...(her Blackberry rings) 
	oh shit, I gotta take this. 
	Turn it down.

		JESSE
	Dont worry bout me, Ive 
	got enough love, for the two 
	us. Oh please...

             JESSE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      ...Im a Love...

             CELESTE
      Jess, turn it down, seriously!

She playfully slaps him. He turns it down. A little.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Hello? Hi. With Jesse, running 
      errands. (to Jesse) Turn it down. 
      More. (back to the phone) Yeah, I 
      can do it now. No, itll be fast, 
      right? (To Jesse) Hey, I have to 
      give a quick sound bite for the New 
      York Times, so no noise please? For 
      a second?

             JESSE
      Maybe. I may have an important call 
      coming in too, so...

They both know he has no important call coming in.

             CELESTE
      (on the phone) Okay. Ready? This 
      year all trends point towards 
      simplicity and comfort.

Celeste is momentarily distracted by a bad driver in front of 
them.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Jess, just go around him! (To the 
      phone) Sorry. 


                                      3.
             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Consumers will be less likely to go 
      out for entertainment.

While Celeste is dictating, Jesse is getting bored. He starts 
looking through the middle console. He finds something. A 
melted tube of Chapstick. Ew. Ooh, a cigarette. Jesse lights 
the cigarette, takes a drag. Celeste looks at Jesse and 
signals to him, Can I have a drag?  

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Uhhh, things like Voodoo, casual 
      wear and cookbooks will see a huge 
      spike in the market.

He hands her the cigarette and she promptly chucks it out the 
window.

             JESSE
      What the shit??

             CELESTE
      (she whispers to Jesse) Shhh. Phone 
      call.(back to her call) Thats 
      enough of a blurb, right? 

Jesse is now checking out nose hairs in the visor mirror. He 
then looks at his teeth. 

             JESSE
      Does this tooth look dark?

Celeste just glares at him.

             CELESTE
      Okay. Call me back if they need 
      more. 

Jesse looks at his tooth again in the rearview mirror.

             JESSE
      Like a little darker than the rest?

Celeste waves her hand to quiet Jesse.

             CELESTE
      Okay, thanks bye. (to Jesse) Cant 
      you just sit still for two minutes? 
      And we talked about this, no more 
      smoking!

             JESSE
      I wasnt smoking, I just found it.


             CELESTE      Come on.

They drive by Urban Light, Chris Burdens installation at 
the entrance of LACMA. They are rows of restored street 
lamps. Celeste sneers.

                                      4.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Really? Street lamps? No. Not doin 
      it. That is not art.

             JESSE
      I think its beautiful.

A beat passes. Then, Jesse pulls over.

             CELESTE
      What are you doing? Why are you 
      stopping?

             JESSE
      Well, your appointment is not until 
      noon and this is that place with 
      the deadstock vintage Italian 
      fabric. I thought it would be good 
      for the guest room windows.

Celeste is truly touched by the gesture.

             CELESTE
      Oh wow...you are so thoughtful.

Jesse smiles, proud of himself.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Thanks, Jess.

She gives him a kiss on the cheek. Jesses phone rings, he 
answers.

             JESSE
      Whassup, muthafucka??

Celeste rolls her eyes and gets out of the car to look at 
fabric.

                                  CUT TO:

 
INT. TOYOTA PRIUS-MINUTES LATER

 
Celeste is getting back in the car with some fabric swatches.

             CELESTE
      Jess, that place is insane. They 
      have tassels that were manufactured 
      for Mussolinis mistress...

             JESSE
      (covering the phone) Sorry, Im on 
      the phone. Its important.

             CELESTE
      Okay then.

Celeste sits quietly while Jesse is on his call.

             JESSE
      Really? I just...dont know what to 
      say. Thank you so much for calling 
      me.

Celeste throws her hands up in silent celebration.

             CELESTE
      (whispers) Did you get the job??

Jesse signals with his finger, one minute.

             JESSE
      Well, sometimes things are just 
      meant to work out.

Celeste looks at him with anticipation.

             JESSE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Okay, great. Great. Talk soon. Bye.

             CELESTE
      Was that the job? Did you get the 
      book job?

             JESSE
      No, but Celeste...

He looks at her and grabs her hand, with tears in his eyes.

             JESSE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      ...a swell came in last night. Out 
      of the Northeast. Its overhead and 
      its glassy.

             CELESTE
      What the fuck are you talking 
      about?


                                      6.
             JESSE
      Malibu. The waves are peeling out 
      there.  

             CELESTE
      Is this about surfing? Youre 
      talking about going surfing. 
      Unbelievable.

             JESSE
      No, this is best part. Skillz got a 
      hi-def digital camera and hes 
      gonna film me!!!

             CELESTE
      Oh, god.

             JESSE
      And were gonna upload it on You 
      Tube!

             CELESTE
      Im not...

             JESSE
      What? Is that not awesome?

             CELESTE
      No, yeah, I just thought it was 
      about the Slate job you interviewed 
      for.

             JESSE
      Oh yeah. No. They havent called 
      yet. But if they dont think Im 
      the right artist to illustrate the 
      book, then its not the right job 
      for me. You know what I mean?

             CELESTE
      I absolutely do, yes. You are a 
      wonderful artist.  But at some 
      point, you will show the world that 
      one day...right?

             JESSE
      Hey, can I drop you at home now?
      Because I just missed a wave. 

             CELESTE
      Well...

             JESSE
      Wait! I just missed another one.


             CELESTE      Yeah. Take me home, its fine. 

                                      7.

INT. TOYOTA PRIUS-30 MINUTES LATER

Jesse is dropping Celeste at home.

             CELESTE
      Be back by six so you can shower.

             JESSE
      Why shower?

             CELESTE
      Dinner with Beth and Tucker.

             JESSE
      Right, right.

             CELESTE
      Have fun shredding your glassy 
      peel.

             JESSE
      Aw, so wrong.

             CELESTE
      Love you.

             JESSE
      Love you too.

He promptly blasts the radio and flashes their signature C 
and J hand sign. She flashes it back. He zooms off.

 
INT. LITTLE DOMS-NIGHT

Celeste and Jesse are on double date with BETH, 30, petite, 
and full of energy and TUCKER, 31, preppy in an indy way. 
These are their best friends from college. Theyre engaged.

             TUCKER
      Did you end up going to see that 
      band at Spaceland last week?

             JESSE
      Oh, The Injured Saint? Yeah, dude. 
      They are real. You know what? They 
      should be your wedding band. 

 
 

                                      8.
             JESSE
	(CONTD)
      Theyre loud but theyre 
      affordable.

             CELESTE
      They opened for Darcy Fudged His 
      Knickers. Now, theyre amazing. 
      Youd be lucky to book them for 
      your wedding. Or you should see if 
      Emergency Breakthrough is 
      available. The horn section is 
      tight.

             BETH
      Its already done. We got the best 
      swing band in New England. 
      Sugarfoot and The Swingin Scrod.

             TUCKER
      I told you, Im not doing it. Swing 
      is so late 90s, honey. 

Beth leans over a gives him a deep kiss. She knows how to 
work him.

             BETH
      I love you. Well talk about this 
      later. 

Celeste looks over the menu. Celeste and Jesses next 
interaction is said with heavy, really bad German accents, 
which is hilarious--only to them.

             CELESTE
      So veee ahhh gawwnna share zeh beet 
      zalad and zeh bolognese, 
      riiiiiiight?

             JESSE
      Yawh. But I em murdering zeh creme 
      brulee alooooone. No sharrrrring.

             CELESTE

             JESSE
      Ve know zeh end of zat story. Yawh

             CELESTE
      Yawh!!!!


                                      9.
Celeste and Jesse giggle at their stupid inside joke for a 
little too long.  Then, there is a deafening lull in the 
conversation. Beth is buttering a piece of bread. She loudly 
drops the knife on her plate and buries her head in her 
hands.

             BETH
      I cant do this. I just cant.

Celeste is genuinely concerned about her friend.

             CELESTE
      Are you okay? Oh no...

             BETH
      Its just not right. I cant hold 
      my tongue. We cant do this 
      anymore.

             CELESTE
      Honey, weddings are stressful, I 
      know all about it. But you guys 
      well be fine!

             BETH
      NO. WE are fine. What the fuck are 
      YOU TWO doing??

Jesse and Celeste look at Beth in amazement.

             CELESTE
      What do you mean?

             JESSE
      Yeah, what do you mean?

              BETH
      What do I mean??  You guys are not 
      together anymore! This is not 
      normal! Youve been separated for 
      SIX MONTHS and you hang out every 
      day like nothings wrong! Its 
      fucking weird!

             TUCKER
      Beth...

             BETH
      No, Tucker, you think its weird 
      too. Speak up for yourself.

             TUCKER
      Its weird. Lets not play charades 
      anymore.


                                      10.
             CELESTE
      No charades. We are separated and 
      were friends. You guys should be 
      happy, all we did was fight before.

             JESSE
      Yeah, you guys should be thrilled 
      about this. Youll never have to 
      pick sides.

             CELESTE
      Yeah, everyones cool.

             BETH
      Everyone is not cool! This is not 
      cool!  Its just not working for 
      me, Im sorry.

Beth gets up and walks out. Celeste and Jesse sit there and 
stare at Tucker in silence.

             JESSE
      Bett iz zo angry.

             CELESTE
      Yah, she iz uber angry. Yahhh.

             TUCKER
      Yeah, you guys are weird. I cant 
      do this. Its fucked up.

Tucker gets up and leaves. Jesse and Celeste watch him leave 
and sip their wine quietly.

 
INT. TOYOTA PRIUS-NIGHT-LATER

 
Celeste drives and Jesse is in the passenger seat.  He has a 
tube of Vaseline Lip Therapy. He is stroking it rapidly as if 
it were a penis. This is not the first time.

             JESSE
      C, look...uhhhh!

Celeste looks at him. She joins in. She reaches over and 
pushes in on the tube. Vaseline comes out of the top.  This 
looks a lot like a penis ejaculating. 

             CELESTE
      Ahhhhh! Oh god! 

They both erupt in laughter. Even though this is the 
thousandth time theyve done this stupid joke, it will always 
be funny. To them.


                                      11.
             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Beth and Tucker are crazy.

             JESSE
      Crazy.

             CELESTE
      Its not weird that we hang out.  
      Do you think its weird we hang 
      out? 

             JESSE
      No, of course not. Youre my best 
      friend.

             CELESTE
      Yeah you too. I mean, we cant not 
      hang out. The last time we didnt 
      talk for longer than a week was in 
      10th grade when you went to Space 
      Camp Canada.

             JESSE
      Yeah, that was 6 weeks of torture. 
      I mean, the anti-gravity training 
      was insane but I missed you.

 
EXT. CELESTES DRIVEWAY- MINUTES LATER

 
Celeste and Jesse stand in the driveway of Celestes house. 
There is a bit of a linger.

                                  CUT TO:

             CELESTE
      Well, Im exhausted.

             JESSE
      Me too.

Celeste walks to her front door with her key and Jesse heads 
towards the side gate with his key. It is now obvious that he 
is living in her guest house.

             CELESTE
      Hey, its kinda chilly tonight, 
      hows the heat in there?

             JESSE
      Oh, its fine. Im fine.

He keeps walking. He turns again to Celeste.


                                      12.
             JESSE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Sorry Im still living here. Times 
      are tough and moneys tight so you 
      know...

             CELESTE
      Jesse, please, you can stay here as 
      long as you like.  Its your 
      studio. Its actually really nice 
      to have you here.

             JESSE
      For me too.

             CELESTE
      Oh, dont forget, the contractor 
      needs to get in there for 
      measurements in the morning.  So 
      make sure your thingys, your 
      sculptures, whatever...are out of 
      the way.

             JESSE
      Got it.

             CELESTE
      Night.

             JESSE
      Night. Love you.

             CELESTE
      Love you too.

 
INT. CELESTES HOUSE-MORNING

 
Celestes morning symphony is under way. She sits in front of 
a bowl of oatmeal, a bowl of berries, a cup of coffee, 
neatly stacked newspapers, her laptop and the television 
tuned to CNN.  She methodically eats, sips her coffee, reads 
the paper, watches TV, and surfs the internet. She is clearly 
a culture vulture. Jesse walks by outside his studio and does 
the C and J sign to Celeste. She does it back 
instinctively. Is it weird that we hang out so much? She 
shakes it off and titters. Shes being ridiculous; its fine.



INT. COFFEE BEAN- MORNING



Celeste walks in, dressed impeccably. Again, in all black.  
She is in a rush, on her Blackberry, bombarded with a hefty 
pre-work crowd. People are in some semblance of a line, 
waiting to order. 


Celeste spots a man in a business suit, taking advantage of the confusion and cutting in front of a woman at the head of 
the line. He orders.

                                      13.

             BUSINESS MAN
      Large coffee, please.

             CELESTE
      Excuse me, sir?

The business man pretends to not hear her.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Sir? You?

She taps him on the arm. He turns around.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      You do realize that you just cut in 
      front of a lot of people.

             BUSINESS MAN
      Oh. Sorry, I didnt know.

             CELESTE
      Did you not?

             BUSINESS MAN
      Im in a rush.

             CELESTE
      So you did know. And everyones in 
      a rush, so...

Other people in line are now paying attention. Celeste wants 
to let it go, but she cant.

             BUSINESS MAN
      Well, she was looking at the 
      pastries, I didnt think she was 
      ready to order.

             CELESTE
      Well, its not just her. Its 
      everyone behind her too. So, if you 
      want to ask all these people if 
      its okay to cut in front of them 
      because you are late, be my guest. 
      Just dont assume that your time is 
      more important than everyone 
      elses.

The business man gets his coffee.


                                      14.
             BUSINESS MAN
      Have a nice day.

             CELESTE
      (sotto) Prick.

 
INT. POP FORM CONFERENCE ROOM-MORNING

 
Pop Form Headquarters looks like the future. No walls, just 
large glass slabs, separate the offices from each other. 

Celeste is on camera, in the middle of conducting a live 
satellite interview for MSNBC. 

             CELESTE 
      American culture is dying. We have 
      an unrelenting appetite for 
      processed junk food, talentless pop 
      stars like Riley Banks and recycled 
      movie franchises like Transformers. 
      The more we consume crap, the more 
      we want crap.

 
INT. MSNBC STUDIOS 

                                  CUT TO:

 
Rachel Maddow is conducting the interview in studio.

             RACHEL MADDOW
      Sounds utterly hopeless. Is there 
      an upshot?

             CELESTE
      I think there will be a groundswell 
      movement towards simplicity.  
      People will start to listen to 
      their most rudimentary needs-- they 
      will crave mental, spiritual and 
      physical nourishment. Its back to 
      basics.

             RACHEL MADDOW
      Wow, a lot to chew on. Well, thanks 
      for being with us today. Youre 
      great, come back any time. For more 
      on this gloomy but interesting 
      subject, look out for trend 
      forecaster, Celeste Martins new 
      book Shitegeist, on bookshelves 
      Monday.


             CELESTE      Thanks so much, Rachel.

                                      15.

 
INT. SCOTTS OFFICE-AFTERNOON

 
SCOTT, 40, Celestes partner, gay but very straight, sharply 
dressed and bespectacled, sits at his desk.  Celeste enters.

             CELESTE
      So I had dinner with the drama club 
      last night.

             SCOTT
      Whos that?

             CELESTE
      Tucker and Beth. Theyre such 
      dicks. They left in protest because 
      they think Jesse and I are being 
      unhealthy. So judgy, right? Were 
      fine.

             SCOTT
      Youre only done when youre done.

             CELESTE
      Spare me the spiritual platitudes, 
      Scotty. If we were gay,(she motions 
      to Scott) no one would even 
      question us being friends! 

             SCOTT
      You and Jesse are clearly not ready 
      to let each other go. And theres 
      nothing wrong with that.

             CELESTE
      Yeah theres nothing wrong with 
      that.  I mean, what do you think?

             SCOTT
      Well, to be honest...

Celeste looks at an e-mail her blackberry and interrupts.

             CELESTE
      Wait, were signing Riley Banks?? 
      When were you going to tell me?? I 
      just trashed her on Rachel Maddow. 
      Great.


                                      16.
             SCOTT
      Yeah, thats why I wanted you to 
      come in. Its a huge account..

             CELESTE
      Scott, you and I built this company 
      so we wouldnt have to take an 
      account like Riley Banks.

             SCOTT
      Well, you and I may not have a 
      company if we dont take Riley 
      Banks.  Recession, remember?

             CELESTE
      Shes like a...soul-less hologram.

             SCOTT
      She is releasing a new album.  She 
      wants us to do the branding and 
      merchandising. We need to take this 
      account.

             CELESTE
      Ok. Fine. Im gonna go eat lunch.

Celeste starts to heads out.

             SCOTT
      If you are looking for my opinion, 
      I do think you should start dating.

             CELESTE
      I dont do dating. The right guy 
      will show up. And Im still on 
      track for my 25 year plan.

             SCOTT
      No one has a 25 year plan. Except 
      for my mortgage company. 

             CELESTE
      First child at 33. Second at 35. 
      Which means I will only be 56 at my 
      eldests college graduation. The 
      bad news is that I may not be at my 
      4th grandchilds high school 
      graduation. But thats okay, I 
      guess.

             SCOTT
      Im fascinated with the mentally 
      ill. 


                                      17.
             CELESTE
      Ive got time.  Im not worried. 

             SCOTT
      Well, do me a favor and get your 
      fuck on before you meet the next 
      guy.

Celeste looks at Scott in shock.

             CELESTE
      What are you doing?

             SCOTT
      Sorry, I was trying to be your 
      saucy gay friend. It didnt feel 
      good. 

             CELESTE
      Yeah dont.


EXT. YOGA YURT-AFTERNOON


Jesse and SKILLZ, 32, another man-boy, in hip-hop gear, wait 
in a very, very long line of very, very hip people at LAs 
trendiest new yogurt place.

             SKILLZ
      The economic climate is real bad, 
      man. And I think my business is 
      taking the hardest hit of all. Its 
      brutal. And no ones talking about 
      it.

             JESSE
      You sell pot.

             SKILLZ
      Not for long, dude. Have you been 
      to those weed pharmacies? Theyre 
      killing me. I gotta branch out. 
      Maybe start working in 
      methamphetamines? Or maybe teach 
      pre-school. I always wanted to do 
      that. I love kids.

Skillz is distracted by something.

             SKILLZ
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Sorry, I know this is serious talky 
      time but would you look at the 
      fucking seat on that girl?


                                      18.
We see a girls apple bottom butt stuffed into blue jeans.

             SKILLZ
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      THAT is a party. 

Jesse does not laugh. He looks like he is in pain.

             JESSE
      I dont think its over.

             SKILLZ
      What?  Her butt? No, it will never 
      be over. It goes on forever. Its 
      like space. So great.

             JESSE
      No, Celeste and I. I think shes 
      just confused and overwhelmed right 
      now about everything. But shell 
      come around. She always does.

             SKILLZ
      Uh oh. Its been a while now.  I 
      think its over, bro. It may be 
      time to accept that and move on.  
      Call that dime Veronica.

Jesse looks uncomfortable.

             JESSE
      That was a one time thing, a couple 
      months after Celeste and I broke 
      up.  Celeste does not know about 
      that.  And we will keep it that 
      way.

             SKILLZ
      Didnt know that was a hit and run. 
      Sounded like you liked her.  

             JESSE
      Well, shes not Celeste. Its 
      always been Celeste. Im not ready 
      to give up.

             SKILLZ
      Okay, but remember, you cant re-
      heat a souffle.

             JESSE
      Huh?


                                      19.
             SKILLZ
      Also, theres Bettys everywhere. 
      Its LA. Maybe its good to remind 
      Celeste that you can pull wool.  
      Make her sweat a little bit. 

             JESSE
      It definitely wouldnt hurt to...go 
      out with somebody. 

They reach the front of the line.

             YOGURT GIRL
      Do you know what you want?

             JESSE
      Yeah, I want to not be a quitter. I 
      dont want to start all over again. 
      I want everything that I believed 
      to have been true to be true. I 
      also want a goji berry/green tea 
      swirl with yogurt chips and Fruity 
      Pebbles. Please.

             SKILLZ
      (to Yogurt Girl) Hey, you should go 
      out on a date with my friend here.

             YOGURT GIRL
      Um, wait, wheres your wife? You 
      guys are here like everyday 
      together.

             JESSE
      Well...were separated.

             YOGURT GIRL
      Oh. Cool. I mean, bummer. But okay. 
      Ill go.

 
INT. LACMA-LATE AFTERNOON

 
Celeste and Beth wander amidst the modern art. They stop to 
take in a Cindy Sherman photo.

             BETH
      Its so...grotesque.

             CELESTE
      But kind of beautiful. In a 
      grotesque way. 


                                      20.
             BETH
      Ugh, lets keep moving. Too many 
      feelings.  

Celeste and Beth wander to the wall and stare at a Damien 
Hirst collage. 

             BETH
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      I need to say this and then Ill 
      never bring it up again. Im sorry 
      I wigged on you guys the other 
      night but I dont know what youre 
      doing. I think its stupid that 
      youre not together. You are best 
      friends and thats the hard part. 
      Nothing else matters.

Celeste and Beth stand in silence. Then:

             CELESTE
      Beth, the reality is I love Jesse 
      dearly but he doesnt have a 
      checking account. Or dress shoes. 
      The father of my children will have 
      a car. But...Jesse will always be 
      my best friend.

             BETH
      Okay fine. Ive said my peace. Its 
      your life. But I definitely dont 
      think he should be living in your 
      guest house. I think youre kind of 
      breaking his heart. Slowly.

             CELESTE
      Jesse is fine.

             BETH
      Can I show you something?

             CELESTE
      Sure.

Beth suddenly pulls Celeste into a corner. With no art.

             BETH
      Okay. Look.

She points to her neck.

             CELESTE
      What am I looking at?


                                      21.
             BETH
      Its a hair. On my NECK.

             CELESTE
      Ewww. Will you get that thing 
      lasered off, please? What the fuck?

             BETH
      I cant because it will pop up 
      somewhere else where I cant keep 
      my eye on it.

             CELESTE
      Are you serious? Thats the 
      craziest thing Ive ever heard. 
      Its not a turnip.

             BETH
      Trust me, I know my body. Its a 
      cruel land mine.

             CELESTE
      Okay, well at least pluck it for 
      Chrissake.

             BETH
      I should, at least before my 
      wedding, right?

             CELESTE
      What is wrong with you? 

Celeste grabs the hair and pulls it out.

             BETH 
      (in pain) AHHHHHHHHHH!

A security guard heads for them.

             CELESTE
      Sorry sir, my friend has a really 
      strong emotional reaction to modern 
      art. 

             BETH
      That was fucking rude.

             CELESTE
      Had to be done. 


EXT. JESSES STUDIO-EARLY EVENING

                                      22.


The studio is beautifully, magically chaotic.  There are 
large canvasses everywhere, paint rags, spray cans, common 
household items turned into sculptures (buttons, clothespin, 
hangers) and mobiles. Celeste walks in. Jesse is on a 
mattress on the floor, hes clearly been sitting there for a 
while. He is fist-deep in a huge bag of Cheetos and hes 
watching the 2008 Beijing Olympics on Tivo. He is watching a 
short feature about Olympian Matthias Steiner, a gold 
medalist in weight lifting.

             CELESTE
      Hey...youre not working?  Are you 
      watching the Olympics? Again? And 
      crying? Again?

Jesse blows his nose.

             JESSE
      Yeah.

             CELESTE
      God, you really love that, dont 
      you?

             JESSE
      Matthias wife died in a car 
      accident last year. 

             CELESTE
      Well, three years ago now but...

             JESSE
      And he dedicated his gold medal to 
      her.  The human spirit 
      is...unbreakable.

Jesse is choked up, can barely speak.

             CELESTE
      Uh huh.  Hey, did you finish that 
      artwork for the Pop Form website?

             JESSE
      Huh? Oh yeah, Im almost done. Im 
      working on it. I think youll 
      really like it.

             CELESTE
      Ill like it more when I have it 
      because I needed it yesterday, 
      so...


Jesse turns off the television, takes a deep breath, wipes his eyes and recovers.

                                      23.

             JESSE
      Celeste, can you sit down for a 
      minute? I have something really 
      important to tell you.

             CELESTE
      Oh. Okay. Does it have something to 
      do with the work you owe me?

Celeste sits. Jesse sits next to her. Again, he has tears in 
his eyes.

             JESSE
      I dont know how to tell you this 
      but...I have a date tonight. Im 
      gonna start dating. People. 

             CELESTE
      A date? Really?  That is so great. 

             JESSE
      It is? You dont...

             CELESTE
      Yeah! Dont cry. Good for you, 
      Jess.

             JESSE
      That doesnt bother you? Wow, okay. 
      Well, its actually the Yogurt 
      Girl. From Yoga Yurt?

             CELESTE
      Really? Yogurt Girl, huh. Shes 
      cute! But so young, right?

             JESSE
      Super young. Her body is all-time.

             CELESTE
      Okay, no need for that. But this is 
      good! You gotta crawl before you 
      walk. I mean shes definitely not 
      gonna be wifey number two, right? 
      Ha.

             JESSE
      Well, its just a date.

She hugs him in an unconsciously patronizing way.


                                      24.
             CELESTE
      Big move. Im proud of you. 

Jesse looks confused and slightly hurt.

             JESSE
      Thanks?

             CELESTE
      Can I get up now?

             JESSE
      Huh? Yeah, sure.

Celeste gets up and is immediately fixated by his hair.

             JESSE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Yeah, Skillz kinda made me do it 
      and from the get go, she was way 
      into...what are you looking at?

             CELESTE
      No, nothing. Are you gonna wear 
      your hair like that?

             JESSE
      What? Oh. I dont know, is it 
      weird?

             CELESTE
      Not weird, just different from how 
      it looks best.

She walks over and starts messing with his hair as he 
continues.

             JESSE
      Anyway, this is what were doing 
      right? Were getting divorced and 
      were friends and were also dating 
      people? Thats what were doing?

She is satisfied with her work. She steps back.

             CELESTE
      There. Better. Youll be great. You 
      dont even need to be great. Just 
      be you. Take her somewhere nice.

             JESSE
      Okay mom.

             CELESTE
      Call me after?


INT. HATFIELDS RESTAURANT-NIGHT

                                      25.


Jesse is on a date with Yogurt girl. Its clear hes hasnt 
been doing a lot of talking.

             YOGURT GIRL
      So I was in school but then I 
      dropped out because I really wanted 
      to work in fashion but its really 
      hard to find a paid internship? So 
      I went back to school and now I 
      work at Yoga Yurt part time but Im 
      really looking to make money doing 
      something I love? But Im sure the 
      universe is looking out for me and 
      when the time is right, the right 
      thing will come along, you know?

                                  CUT TO:

 
INT. CELESTES BEDROOM- NIGHT

Celeste is in bed on the computer. She hears noise from the 
outside. She listens more intently and hears Jesse... and a 
woman, giggling and talking loudly. Then, the studio door 
shuts. Is Yogurt Girl sleeping over? He wouldnt do that. 
Would he?

 
EXT. CELESTES GARDEN- NEXT MORNING

 
 
Again, with the morning symphony. Celeste drinks coffee, eats 
breakfast, surfs the internet and flips through magazines. 
This time, shes also listening to a song from Riley Banks 
new album.  Its exactly what she thought it would be.  
Overproduced, auto-tuned and meaningless. She nods her head, 
yeah, I get it.  She turns it off.

Celeste cant stop herself from constantly looking over at 
the studio to see if Yogurt Girl is still in there.  Finally, 
a sleeping Jesse stirs for a minute and changes position. He 
is alone. Phew.

 
INT. BORDERS BOOKS-LATER THAT DAY

 
Celeste, Beth, Tucker and Jesse browse as a foursome for 
books.

             CELESTE
      Where is it? They told me it would 
      be in new releases...


                                      26.
Celeste searches frantically for her book. She peeks around a 
corner at a very obscured aisle with a sign reading More New 
Releases.  Three copies of her book, Shitegeist appear in 
the very bottom row, barely visible. She is disappointed. 

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Thats what I call placement.

She grabs a copy of her book and briskly walks back to the 
front of the store. 

             BETH
      Well you probably shouldnt steal 
      it. Even if it is yours.

Celeste marches to the Oprahs Book Club table and swiftly 
replaces the center display book with her own.

             CELESTE
      There.

             BETH
      But you dont have the O on your 
      cover, you cant do that!

             CELESTE
      Yes I can.

Jesse and Tucker arrive and see the book.

             JESSE
      There you guys are...youre on 
      Oprahs Book List?? Thats so 
      great!

Something catches Celestes eye.

             CELESTE
      Some people are browsing my book. 
      Guys, come with me to eavesdrop ...

Celeste, Tucker and Beth head off. Then:

             GIRL
	(V.O.)
      Jesse?

Jesse turns to see VERONICA, 26, stunning and European.

             JESSE
      Veronica?

             VERONICA
      Yeah, hey. How are you?


                                      27.
             JESSE
      Good, good. You look great.

             VERONICA
      Thanks, you too. Hows your clothes 
      pin collage going?

             JESSE
      Slowly, but its going.

             VERONICA
      Well, dont give up.  Your work is 
      really unique. And beautiful.  I 
      hope that doesnt sound...

             JESSE
      No, thats means a lot, thank you.  

They looks at each other for a beat.

             JESSE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      I had so much fun...that night. Im 
      so sorry I didnt call you. My life 
      is just...

             VERONICA
      I had a lot of fun too.  

There is silence, as Beth, Celeste and Tucker arrive and 
stare at her. Who is this creature??

             JESSE
      Oh sorry, Veronica, this is Beth 
      and Tucker and Celeste.

Veronica notices Celestes name on the book.

             VERONICA
      Oh, this is your book? I read an 
      excerpt online, its really 
      compelling.

             CELESTE
      Wow, thank you. That is so nice.

             VERONICA
      Well, nice to see you. 

             JESSE
      Oh you too. Take care.

She turns and leaves.


                                      28.
             CELESTE
      What is that? 

             JESSE
      That was uh...Veronica.

             CELESTE
      Story?

             JESSE
      No story. Just this girl I met a 
      while ago.

             CELESTE
      Huh. Shes pretty.

Celeste changes focus again and turns to a Borders employee 
to loudly and unconvincingly act out Interested Reader for 
other shoppers to hear.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      EXCUSE ME SIR? WHERE CAN I FIND 
      MORE COPIES OF THIS BOOK 
      SHITEGEIST FOR MY FRIENDS? I 
      HEARD IT IS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!

He looks at her like shes crazy and keeps walking. And so do 
her friends.

 
EXT. TROUBADOR THEATER-NIGHT

 
Jesse and Skillz are exiting a Bizmarkie concert, surrounded 
by older hip-hop fans and young hipsters who werent alive 
when the Biz dropped his first album. They are trashed.

             SKILLZ
      Oh baby youuuuuuuu, you got what I 
      neeeeeed...

             JESSE 
      And you say hes just a friend, and 
      you say hes just a friend....

       		JESSE
	Oh baby youuuuu....

		SKILLZ
	Oh baby youuuuu....

Jesses iPhone rings. A very flirty picture of Celeste comes 
up.

             SKILLZ
      No, no, no. Ignore for sure.


                                      29.
             JESSE
      Uh, I just need to...(picks up) 
      Hey.

             SKILLZ
      (whispering) Nooooo!

             JESSE
      (talking to Celeste) Uh huh. Okay. 
      Okay. No, Im not busy. (hangs up) 
      Uh, Im gonna go home.

             SKILLS
      Come on, after the show its the 
      after party.

             JESSE 
      Theres an Ikea dresser that she 
      needs me to build.

Skillz takes this in. He is impressed.

             SKILLZ
      Huh. Really, cowboy? Are you 
      guys...

             JESSE
      I told you pal, I know what Im 
      know Im doing. She just needed 
      time.

 
INT. CELESTES HOUSE-NIGHT

 
Celeste is in a corner with a glass of wine and a HUGE bag of 
nuts and bolts. She had a fight with a dresser and the 
dresser won. Jesse uses his key and enters.

             CELESTE
      Im in here! Fuck Sweden!

             JESSE
      Oh baby youuuuu....

             CELESTE
      It was definitely easier to build 
      the Brooklyn Bridge, I think.

             JESSE
      Well, how hard can it be? Its a 
      dresser, right?

                              TIME CUT TO:


 INT. CELESTES HOUSE- 30 MINUTES LATER

                                      30.

 
Jesse is drunker than before and sitting where Celeste was 
earlier. Crying, frustrated. Hes covered in sawdust and nuts 
and bolts.

             JESSE
      Fuck me!!! Do you think they 
      intentionally pick a random piece 
      of furniture to make totally 
      unbuildable, just to fuck with 
      you??!

             CELESTE
      Thank you!

             JESSE
      Wait. I got it.


INT. CELESTES HOUSE- 30 MORE MINUTES LATER


We see Jesse and Celeste admire their dresser as they drink 
wine.

                              TIME CUT TO:

             CELESTE
      Perfect.

             JESSE
      Fucking lay-up.

We reveal that they are looking at a small, mangled, Swedish 
robot constructed from the nuts and bolts and wood panelling 
that should have been the dresser. They both slide to the 
floor in satisfaction. They look at their artwork. They 
laugh; they are pretty drunk.

             CELESTE
      Ruscha meets Basquiat...

             JESSE
      ...meets Serra meets Corky from 
      Life Goes On.

             CELESTE
      Yeah. Hes a vegan, you know.

             JESSE
      Cherish. That is so cute.

They share a laugh. 


                                      31.
             CELESTE
      Youre cute.

Celeste looks at him. She kisses him. He kisses back. It gets 
hotter. They fall back.

                                 FADE TO:

 
INT. CELESTES BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

 
Celeste and Jesse are in bed.  Celeste is asleep. Jesse wakes 
up and gently kisses Celeste all over her face. This wakes 
her up. She is hungover and confused.

             CELESTE
      Hey. What are you doing?

             JESSE
      I love you.

Celeste does not respond.  She pops up out of bed.

             CELESTE
      Okay...

             JESSE
      We should talk about this.

             CELESTE
      Yeah. Whoa, we were drunk. What a 
      bad idea. Im sorry.

             JESSE
      Dont be sorry. It was nice. And I 
      love you.

             CELESTE
      Oh Jess, I dont...come on, we were 
      drunk, and the dresser and I 
      thought...youre dating other 
      people!

             JESSE
      Only to...god, Im so stupid. 

He realizes how pathetic it sounds. 

             CELESTE
      Oh no, I thought...

             JESSE
      You thought what?


                                      32.
             CELESTE
      Well, clearly I wasnt thinking. Or 
      I wouldnt have let it happen. Come 
      on Jess, were not getting back 
      together, you didnt think...

Celeste realizes he did think...Jesse is crushed. He gets up 
and leaves. He turns.

             JESSE
      You know, theres a guy that you 
      can call, from Ikea, that will 
      build youre dresser. You should 
      call him. Hell, hell probably fuck 
      you too. Im a fucking idiot.

             CELESTE
      Jess! No, I didnt..Jess!

Celeste collapses back in the bed.


INT. EQUINOX GYM-MORNING


A bunch of Los Angeles hipsters file out of a yoga class. 
Everyone is sweaty and a little out of it. Celeste heads out 
as she towels off. She heads towards the shoe cubby holes.

             PAUL
      Hello.

             CELESTE
      What?

             PAUL
      I said hello.

             CELESTE
      Oh. Hi.

Celeste keeps walking briskly. PAUL, 35, short but handsome, 
tries to keep up with her.

             PAUL
      (a little too loud) How was your 
      practice?

             CELESTE
      My practice?? It was...wait, 
      what?...it was fine. (who is this 
      guy?)


                                      33.
             PAUL
      I see you in class a lot. You have 
      a great warrior two. Are you 
      single?

Celeste puts on her shoes.

             CELESTE
      Are you really doing this right 
      now? Youre really doing this right 
      now.

Paul realizes that his game is wack. Oh well.

             PAUL
      Yeah, I cant believe it either.  I 
      dont do this, its just happening, 
      I cant stop...it...what do you do?

             CELESTE
      Just gonna jump right in there. 
      Wow, Captain Conversation.

             PAUL
      Paul. Heres my card.

             CELESTE
      You bring cards to yoga??

             PAUL
      Look, youre really pretty. Im not 
      good at this. Help.

He smiles nervously.

             CELESTE
      (she looks at the card.) A 
      financial analyst. Cool. 

             PAUL
      Not really.  Its not cool.  Did 
      you ever tell me what you did for a 
      living?

             CELESTE
      No, no I didnt. 

There is a pause in conversation. Celeste continues to put 
her shoes on.

             PAUL
      Well, will you? Id love to know.


                                      34.
             CELESTE
      Im a trend forecaster. I forecast 
      trends.

Paul scoffs at the notion that this is a real career.

             PAUL
      Trend forecaster. Really? Huh.

They have reached the parking lot. Celeste turns to him with 
purpose.

             CELESTE
      You traded in your Porsche for an 
      Audi because the economy is tanking 
      and youre afraid youll lose your 
      job soon. You bought a Samsung cell 
      phone because you think it makes 
      you seem more business-oriented, 
      unlike the iPhone which is for 
      teenage girls. You go to yoga 
      because you went to a sub Ivy 
      League college, spent the last ten 
      years working long weeks and 
      drinking all weekend and you feel 
      like its time to do something 
      spiritual.  Nice to meet you, 
      (looks at the card) Paul.

Celeste walks away. Paul remains where he is, flummoxed.


EXT. CELESTES GARDEN-LATER


Celeste enters through her side gate. She has some Chinese 
takeout in her hand. She heads for the studio. She sees that 
Jesse is not there. Neither is any of his shit. Its 
completely empty and sterile now.  Hes gone. 

 
EXT. TAXI-LATER THAT NIGHT

 
Celeste is about to go on the road for work. She is on the 
phone.

             CELESTE
      No, just make sure the San Fran 
      focus group has a little more 
      diversity than last time. It was 
      like a rave. Without drugs. Okay. 

She hangs up and pauses. Then dials again.


             CELESTE	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Hey, Jess, its me. Im getting on 
      a plane but Id really like to talk 
      to you. I dont know what happened 
      last night. Hope youre okay.  Call 
      me.

                                      35.

INT. BOSTON FOUR SEASONS HOTEL LOBBY RESTAURANT-DAY 

 
We see Celeste having lunch with a group of eight teenagers. 
She asks questions, they share laughs, she engages with them. 
She is good at this. She excuses herself to make a phone 
call.

                                  CUT TO:

 
INT. SAN FRANCISCO W HOTEL ROOM-NIGHT

INT. DOWNTOWN L.A. DINER-LATE AFTERNOON

 
 
Jesse is mid-laugh and looks at his phone to see Celeste is 
calling. He presses Ignore. We see that he is sitting with 
a women. We reveal that it is: Veronica.

             VERONICA
      Im glad you called.

Jesse smiles big.

 
INT. SAN FRANCISCO W HOTEL ROOM-NIGHT

 
                                  CUT TO:

             CELESTE
      Hey. Its me. Again. I miss you.  
      Anyway, call me. Okay. Bye.

She hangs up, takes a breath and then, to herself:

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      I love you. Im so sorry. Ive 
      always loved you.

She chuckles.

      Of course. Stupid.

 
EXT. STREET - WEST HOLLYWOOD-DAY

Jesse is walking.

             JESSE
      (on the phone) Hey. Youre back. I 
      want to talk to you.


INT. CELESTES HOUSE-SUNDOWN

Celeste is in her home office, working on the Riley account.

             CELESTE
      Yeah, I want to talk to you too. 
      Where have you been?? Its been 
      like two weeks. So much to lay 
      down...like, did you know that pay-
      per-view porn is available in 
      Cantonese?

 
EXT. STREET-WEST HOLLYWOOD-SUNDOWN

             JESSE
      Really? Like subtitles or dubbed? 
      Wait, actually, Im really close to 
      your house right now.  Can I come 
      by for a minute? Its....important.

                                  CUT TO:


INT. CELESTES HOUSE-NIGHT

Celeste puts away groceries.

             JESSE
      Okay. I have to tell you something.

             CELESTE
      Me too. Wait, you first. Are you 
      gay?

             JESSE
      No, not gay. 

He takes a really deep breath.

 

 


                                      37.
             JESSE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Um, youre not gonna believe this 
      but...

             CELESTE
      (playfully) Oh no, did you go on 
      another date? 

             JESSE
      Im having a baby.

             CELESTE
      I dont understand.

             JESSE
      Im having a baby.

Celeste is still busy, putting away groceries. She is half-
listening.

             CELESTE
      What do you mean?

             JESSE
      I am having a baby.

Celeste opens the pantry and puts away cereal.

             CELESTE
      With another person?

             JESSE
      Yes. With another person.

Celeste takes out cold cuts from the bag and opens the 
fridge.

             CELESTE
      Um. What? Sorry, Im confused. 
      Wait, what? What the fuck? With 
      whom?

             JESSE
      With Veronica.

             CELESTE
      Veronica?? Whats a Veronica?

             JESSE
      You actually met her. That day at 
      the book store.


                                      38.
             CELESTE
      Huh.  But thats not even 
      physically possible, that was two 
      weeks ago.

             JESSE
      Well, the truth is, I slept with 
      Veronica three months ago. It was 
      just a one night thing. But shes 
      pregnant.

Celeste rearranges the fruit bowl.

             CELESTE
      Whoa. Okay. Shit. Didnt know about 
      that.  But thats not important 
      right now. This is not good. 
      Alright. Okay. You and I are gonna 
      deal with this. We will, well just 
      have to. What do you need me to do?

             JESSE
      No, you dont have to do anything.

             CELESTE
      But you dont even know this 
      person, right?

             JESSE
      Yeah I know her. I mean, Im 
      getting to know her. And I really 
      want to make it work with her.

             CELESTE
      Make it work?? You slept with her 
      once! What are you talking about?

             JESSE
      Ive actually been seeing her, 
      well, a lot, recently. And I think 
      I really like her.

             CELESTE
      So what you're saying is you got a 
      girl pregnant and now you think you 
      like her because shes pregnant? 
      Or...Im really confused.

             JESSE
      The universe is fucking weird, 
      Celeste. I slept with her months 
      ago and never called her after. 


                                      39.
             JESSE
	(CONTD)
      But we started hanging recently and 
      she told me she was pregnant with 
      my child.  I know its crazy, but 
      it just feels...right.  It was like 
      this really weird retroactive gift. 
      I dont know...

             CELESTE
      Can you excuse me for a second? 

Celeste gets up and walks slowly to the bathroom. She gently 
shuts the door. She looks around, not knowing what to do with 
herself. She focuses on a crack in the wall, she looks closer 
and then grabs the wall, thinking she might faint. She 
silently begins to sob, mouth open, eyes shut tight. She 
collapses on the wall. She is in silent turmoil. Is this 
really happening?

                                  CUT TO:


INT. CELESTES LIVING ROOM- A MOMENT LATER


Jesse is sitting, waiting. He checks his cell phone. He hears 
the toilet flush. A moment goes by.  Celeste re-enters, 
having pulled it together. But her face is still wet with 
tears.

             CELESTE
      Sorry about that. I had something 
      in my eye.

             JESSE
      Right.  Look, I know this is so 
      sudden. And so weird. Ive been 
      holding on to us, this idea of us, 
      for so long. And I know youve 
      wanted me to let go. So Im sorry.  
      You were right, were friends. We 
      will always be friends. And I need 
      that now.

             CELESTE
      Of course.

             JESSE
      Thank you. Love you.

Jesse gives Celeste a big, long hug.

             JESSE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Wait, you had something to tell me 
      too. Sorry...

Celeste takes a beat.

             CELESTE
      It was nothing.

She forces a smile.

 
INT. CELESTES OFFICE-DAY

 
Celeste is on the computer. She drinks coffee.  Scott peeks 
in.

             SCOTT
      Hello?

             CELESTE
      Hey.

Celeste lets out a guffaw.

             SCOTT
      What are you doing?

             CELESTE
      Im just following Diddy Twitty.

             SCOTT
      I dont...know what that means.

             CELESTE
      Its Sean Combs Twitter page. 
      Theres also a singing competition 
      on television. Its called American 
      Idol? Keep up.

             SCOTT
      Okay saucy. You dont have to be so 
      saucy.

             CELESTE
      Well, just part of our job, 
      so...ready for breaking news? Jesse 
      is having a baby with some girl. 
      Crazy.

             SCOTT
      Whoa. Wow. Did you even know he was 
      seeing someone?

             CELESTE
      Its this girl he slept with once a 
      couple of months ago. 


                                      41.
             CELESTE
	(CONTD)
      And now hes making it work with 
      her.  Plane crash.

             SCOTT
      I dont know what to say. I am so 
      sorry, Celeste.

             CELESTE
      No need, Scott, Im totally fine.

             SCOTT
      Are you?

             CELESTE
      Look, I wasnt going to have his 
      baby. So, good for him.  

             SCOTT
      Well, its great that youre so 
      resolved about this but its also 
      okay for you to have feelings. Its 
      very sudden.

Celeste pauses to consider this.

             CELESTE
      Right. Well, let me see...mmmm, 
      nope, Im fine. I promise. Not in 
      love with him anymore. It kind of 
      makes it easier.

Scott is not convinced.  Celeste is still distracted by the 
computer. 

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Oh my god, Diddys snowboarding for 
      the first time in Mammoth! Amazing.  
      I actually have a date tonight.

             SCOTT 
      Um...thats great. Whos the guy?

             CELESTE
      The yahoo who did Pop Forms taxes 
      last quarter. Hes been asking me 
      out forever. Not the one, but itll 
      be nice to be admired.

             SCOTT
      I agree, go be admired. Who knows, 
      you may actually even simulate 
      human emotion.


 INT. CELESTES HOUSE-EARLY EVENING

                                      42.

 
Celeste, in workout clothes, is cleaning up her house 
maniacally. She is walking past her office. The Ikea robot 
she built with Jesse catches her attention for a moment. She 
keeps walking.

 
INT. MADEOS RESTAURANT-NIGHT

 
Celeste and MAX, 38, handsome and clean cut, are sitting at 
dinner. They have just ordered.

             CELESTE
      Thank you.

She hands the menu back to the waiter. 

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      My foot actually pronates. And my 
      I.T. band is strained when I run, 
      which really hurts. So Dr. Ozar 
      recommended a foot specialist who 
      made these customized orthotics for 
      me and its amazing how much better 
      I feel.

             MAX
      Well, actually I...

Suddenly, Celeste catches a glimpse of Jesse, sitting at the 
bar, by himself, watching tv. She is not prepared for this.

             CELESTE
      OH MY GOD. My ex is here. Oh god, 
      oh no, we just made eye contact. 
      Maybe he didnt see me. Wait, he 
      did.  Hes coming over. Oh god, 
      this is so awkward.(to Max) You 
      should probably leave.

             MAX
      Wait, what? I dont think...really?

             CELESTE
      Yeah, just go. 

Jesse is at the table.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Too late.  Here he is, heyyyy.

             JESSE
      I just wanted to say hi. Im Jesse.


                                      43.
             CELESTE
      Oh, this is Matt.

             MAX
      Max.

             CELESTE
      Mack.

             MAX
      Max.

             JESSE
      Nice to meet you, Max.

             CELESTE
      Were just here. Just eating. Its 
      a date. Im dating.

             JESSE
      Cool. The puttanesca special is the 
      thing to get.

             MAX
      Good to know. I ordered that. 

A moment of awkward silences passes.

             CELESTE
      Who are you here with?

             JESSE
      Oh, just here alone. Watching the 
      Lakers.

             MAX
      Kobe-LeBron tonight, right?

             JESSE
      Yes. Epic.

             MAX
      So psyched I tivoed it.

             JESSE
      Nice to meet you, man. Good to see 
      you, C.

        	MAX
	You too.

		CELESTE
	You too.


             MAX
      	Hes cool.


                                      44.
             CELESTE
      Uh huh.

Celeste immediately scarfs down her salad which has just 
arrived. Shes quiet.

             MAX
      How was that? Are you okay?

             CELESTE
      Im fine!  

Celeste stares at Jesse at the bar.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      He always loved the meatballs here.

             MAX
      What?

             CELESTE
      Nothing.  Do you like bread?

             MAX
      Bread? Um, yeah, I like bread.

             CELESTE
      Cool, cool.

Silence, once again.

 
EXT. MADEOS RESTAURANT-NIGHT

                                  CUT TO:

 
Celeste and Max wait for their cars at the valet stand. Maxs 
car arrives. He pays the valet.

             CELESTE
      This was great! Im free next 
      Wednesday? Sushi?

             MAX
      Um, I dont think we should.

             CELESTE
      Oh, because of mercury poisoning? I 
      think thats a myth.  I go to this 
      acupuncturist that...


                                      45.
             MAX
      No, I think you may need some time. 
      To get over, you know, your 
      divorce. It took me a long time to 
      start dating after mine. 

             CELESTE
      Thank you for your concern but Im 
      just fine. I guess youre just not 
      a match for me.

             MAX
      Well, have a good night. Good luck.

Max gets in his car and is gone. Celeste stands there, 
confused and alone. She shakes him off.

             CELESTE
      (sotto) Whatever.

 
EXT. LA CIENEGA BLVD.

 
Celeste is running...hard. It is a cacophony of street sounds 
around her: traffic, honking, speeding, Celeste listens to 
the Dirty Projectors Stillness is the Move on her iPod and 
joyfully runs across the street.

 
EXT. H.D. BUTTERCUP- CULVER CITY-A COUPLE WEEKS LATER

 
Celeste arrives to meet Beth. She is in full marathon gear. 
She waves at Beth and enters, panting.

             CELESTE
      Hi honey!

             BETH
      Hi, wow, you are really out of 
      breath. Did you fucking run here?? 
      From West Hollywood??

             CELESTE
      Yeah I ran. Just started. Its 
      really fun.

             BETH
      Youre soaking wet. Isnt that like 
      1miles??

             CELESTE
      13.5 actually. I was just clearing 
      my head, you know, keeping the 
      endorphins up.


Celeste pants like shes about to collapse. She doubles over with her hands on her knees. Shes in pain.

                                      46.

             BETH
      Do you...want to sit down?

             CELESTE
      Oh, okay! Wow, is this it? Its so 
      nice.

Celeste flops on the couch full prostrate. A saleswoman 
approaches.

             SALESWOMAN
      Im so sorry but thats a one-of-a-
      kind piece that was handwoven by a 
      tribe of Afghani women. So if you 
      could maybe just sit over there?

The saleswoman points to a metal industrial, uncomfortable 
looking chair.

             CELESTE
      Right. Sorry. Totally.

             BETH
      Wow, you are a sweat tsunami.

             CELESTE
      You should get it. Its really 
      pretty.

Celeste gets up and there is an outline of Celestes entire 
body in sunblock and sweat. They look at the wreckage.

             BETH
      Uh boy.

             CELESTE
      Dont worry. I know people who can 
      get that out. Easily.

             BETH
      Okay. I guess Im getting it.


INT. H.D. BUTTERCUP-SALES COUNTER-DAY


The saleswoman is ringing Beth up for the couch. It is 
basically ruined.

             CELESTE
      The Riley account is a handful. 
      Ive been sooooo swamped.  


                                      47.
             BETH
      Its great youre staying busy...

             CELESTE
      (about the couch) If it doesnt 
      come out, I can have it 
      reupholstered.

             BETH
      Thanks. Hows dating?

             SALESWOMAN
      Sorry, can I get your card?

             BETH
      Here you go.

             CELESTE
      Great. Datings really great.

             BETH
      Have you talked to Jesse?

             CELESTE
      No, but I actually ran into him 
      last night. I think hes getting a 
      little fat.

             BETH
      I think hes been looking pretty 
      fit lately. (to the saleswoman) Can 
      I get a rush delivery on that?

             CELESTE 
      So youve seen Jesse?

             BETH
      ...Yeah, I have.

             CELESTE
      Huh. Have you hung out with...

             BETH
      Veronica?

             CELESTE
      Yeah.

             BETH
      Yes. I have.

Silence.


                                      48.
             SALESWOMAN
      So, my first available delivery is 
      Monday afternoon. Does that work 
      for you?

             BETH
      Yeah, thats fine. If you can you 
      just call my cell...

             CELESTE
      Shes dumb, right?

             BETH
      Huh? Oh no, not dumb. Simple.

             CELESTE
      Simple means dumb.

             BETH
      No, actually, simple in a really 
      elegant way. 

             CELESTE
      Elegant??

The saleswoman senses awkwardness.

             SALESWOMAN
      Okay, so youre all set then.

             CELESTE
      Elegant?? 

             BETH
      Thanks a lot. (to Celeste)

They head for the exit.

             BETH
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      I thought you would be happy for 
      him.  

             CELESTE
      I am, I just didnt realize that 
      Monica was elegant.

             BETH
      Veronica. And you know what? You 
      would probably really like her. 

Beth studies Celeste for a moment.


                                      49.
             BETH
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Youre not having regrets about 
      Jesse?

             CELESTE
      Not one.

             BETH
      Please let me drive you home. Im 
      afraid youll drown.

             CELESTE
      Sure. I have a date tonight so I 
      should probably shower before then.

Beth looks at a sopping Celeste.

             BETH
      Yes. Shower. Whos the date?

             CELESTE
      Rupert Bates.

             BETH
      Rupert Bates? The Gap model?? Oh my 
      god, hes so hot but hes like 15.

             CELESTE
      22.  Skillz set me up.  Hes about 
      to be a huge star.  Hes filming 
      20,000 B.C.? Its the prequel to 
      10,000 B.C. 

             BETH
      Fuck, I LOVED that movie. 

             SALESWOMAN
      I loved that movie too! It really 
      spoke to me.

 
INT. MULLHOLLAND DRIVE MODERN HOUSE-NEXT NIGHT

 
RUPERT BATES, 22, very handsome, British, wearing a leather 
jacket, sporting tousled actor hair is playing a hideously 
earnest original song on the guitar. He sings with passion. 
He looks up at Celeste and winks.

Celeste,on the couch, looking slightly mortified. She smiles 
tepidly at him. 

                                  CUT TO:


Rupert finishes the song, closes his eyes and hangs his head. A beat of silence. Celeste musters up a short and slow round 
of applause.

                                      50.

             CELESTE
      That was so...good.

             RUPERT
      I wrote that for my mum.

             CELESTE
      Lucky lady.  So how do you know 
      Skillz?

             RUPERT
      He provides me with the happy smoky 
      green treats.

             CELESTE
      (sotto) Ew.

Celeste cringes. What a dork.  Rupert slides next to Celeste 
and is all of a sudden right in her face. He touches her 
hair. He kisses her, deeply. He pulls away and takes her in.

             RUPERT
      Hello, Special One.

             CELESTE
      Oh...hi. Oh god. (whispers) Oh no, 
      no, no I gotta go.


INT. POP FORM OFFICES-NEXT DAY-AFTERNOON

People file out of the conference room. Celeste walks down 
the hall quickly to the bathroom.


INT. POP FORM BATHROOM



Celeste enters a stall. Then, she hears two girls enter the 
bathroom. RILEY, 19 and SAVANNAH, 22, are chatting and 
primping. Celeste goes quiet and listens.

             RILEY 
      Ugh. My hair is so dry. It looks 
      like straw.

Savannah quickly pops a pill. Then offers one to Riley.

             SAVANNAH
      Here.  Do you want an Adderall?


                                      51.
             RILEY
      No, that shit makes me feel like a 
      robot.  Speaking of robot, who the 
      hell designed this place?  Its 
      like Spock and his eyebrows are 
      about to walk around the corner.

Celeste takes this opportunity to flush and come out of the 
stall.

             CELESTE
      Hi Riley, Im Celeste, Im a 
      partner at Pop Form.  

             RILEY
      Hey. Wow, youre pretty.

Riley looks closer at her skin and picks at it.

             RILEY
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Why am I breaking out?

             SAVANNAH
      Too much sugar? Coffee? Alcohol? 

             RILEY
      Ugh, maybe its my skin regime.

             CELESTE
      Um...its actually regimen?

             RILEY
      Sorry?

             CELESTE
      Regime is a system of government. 
      Its a skin regimen.

Riley and Savannah glare at Celeste.

             RILEY
      Thanks, Scrabble. Nice to meet you.

They leave.

             CELESTE
      Charming.

 INT. POP FORM CONFERENCE ROOM-AN HOUR LATER

                                      52.

 
The Riley Banks branding strategy meeting is under way.  
Slides are being shown, Scott is giving a presentation on 
design ideas.  Celeste is distracted and on her Blackberry.  
We see an INSERT of Celestes Blackberry on Dictionary.com, 
looking up regime: a mode or system of rule or government.

             SCOTT
      Celeste has some ideas for the logo 
      which are looking really great.

He looks to Celeste who is not paying attention.  She is busy 
learning that she was right and Riley was wrong.  Celeste 
looks up and shoots a patronizing smile at Riley. Riley 
catches her and looks away uncomfortably.

             SCOTT
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Celeste?  Do you wanna...

             CELESTE
      Right. Yes. Sorry.  So we are going 
      for an industrial feel with the 
      artwork...

 
INT. CELESTES OFFICE-AN HOUR LATER

 
Scott enters.

             SCOTT
      Hello, Special One.

             CELESTE
      Uh, you got my IM.

             SCOTT
      Sounds so awful.

             CELESTE
      Where are the guys who dont wear 
      makeup for a living? And maybe a 
      little intellect? A little 
      intellect wouldnt hurt anybody.

Scott has an idea.

             SCOTT
      Wait, wait. Youve never met Nick, 
      right? Nick Moran?  

             CELESTE
      The photographer? You know him?


                                      53.
             SCOTT
      Yeah, we went to school together. 
      This could be perfect.

             CELESTE
      (she sings, like shes in a 
      musical) Im uncomfortable with 
      daaaaaating.  I dont like any of 
      iiiiiit.

             SCOTT
      (he sings back) Trust meeeee. You 
      will liiiiike hiiiim. Also, I love 
      cooo-ooock. 

             CELESTE
      You really got to try a little 
      harder to integrate the gayness, 
      Scott.

 
EXT. CHATEAU MARMONT BALCONY- NIGHT

 
Celeste sits on the balcony with Nick Moran. He has Indy 
rocker hair and a Los Feliz beard. Hes hip and smart in an 
effortless way. Celeste is feeling him. They drink wine and 
laugh.

             CELESTE
      So you pissed in your pants?

             NICK
      I waited seven hours. Three of them 
      soaking in my own pee. But I 
      finally got the shot of 
      Ahmadinejad.

He hands her a photograph. 

             CELESTE
      Wow. That is incredible. I think 
      hes smiling, maybe.

             NICK
      He is.  I think the piss stain 
      running down my jeans made him 
      laugh.

             CELESTE
      Well, the world will think youre 
      brilliant. No one will ever know 
      but me. 


                                      54.
             NICK
      I was nominated for a Pulitzer. I 
      didnt win.

             CELESTE
      Well, the guy who won shit his 
      pants, so...

They laugh. They are connecting.

             NICK
      (looking at his watch) Oh my god, 
      we missed our reservation. It was 
      at 8:30. Should I call down and see 
      if they can still take us?

             CELESTE
      How about room service?

             NICK
      Perfect.

Nick and Celeste are kissing. Its passionate but tender. 
They stop and their foreheads rest against each others and 
they take a deep breath. They speak in hushed tones. 

             CELESTE
      That was really, really nice.

             NICK
      Um, yeah. So, what are you doing 
      for the rest of your life?

             CELESTE
      Making out with you.

They start to kiss again. 

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      I dont remember it ever feeling 
      like this.

They continue to kiss. Celeste notices that she and the couch 
are vibrating. She looks down. Oh no. Nick is masturbating. 
Can he really be masturbating?

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      (whisper)What are you doing?

      (whisper)What do you think 
      Im doing?

             CELESTE
      (whisper) Why are you doing that? 
      Dont do that..It was going so 
      well. 

             NICK
      Shhhhh.

Celeste pulls away slowly, shaking her head, no. Nick keeps 
going. Eyes closed.

             NICK
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Watch me. Im almost there.

Celeste cannot believe what she is watching.

             CELESTE
      Almost where?? No!

Celeste quickly grabs her stuff and gets the hell out of 
dodge.

             NICK
      Ah, ah, ahhhhhhhhh! 

Nick recovers from his climax and looks around to realize 
shes gone.

             NICK
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Celeste?

 
EXT. SANTA MONICA BEACH-NEXT MORNING

 
Celeste runs really hard, listening to her Sunny Levines 
Glass Jaw on her iPhone. She stops suddenly. She sees 
Jesses number, she hits Ignore.  She starts running again 
with purpose.

 
EXT. ELYSIAN WAY ECHO PARK- NEXT DAY

 
Celeste drives and listen to her phone on bluetooth.

             JESSE V.O.
      Hey, so, Im glad you can meet up. 
      4pm is good. Theres this little 
      place by me, Vegan Vittles on 
      Elysian Way, kinda hard to find, 
      call me if you get lost.

INT. VEGAN VITTLES-MINUTES LATER


Celeste enters and sees Jesse sitting at a table in a small, 
folksy restaurant. Celeste is on the phone. She waves at 
Jesse and gestures one second.

             CELESTE
      No, I dont want to do a video 
      chat. Yeah. Just tell her she needs 
      to get to L.A. tomorrow. Okay. (she 
      hangs up, now on the Blackberry) 
      Sorry, one second, I just have to 
      send this e-mail. 

Jesse sits there and wait for several seconds for her to 
finish her e-mail.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      There. Hi.

             JESSE
      Hi. Whats up?

             CELESTE
      A lot. (to waitress) Can I get some 
      coffee?

             WAITRESS
      We have yerba matte?

             CELESTE
      Um, green tea?

             WAITRESS
      We have decaf green tea.

             CELESTE
      Waters fine.

             WAITRESS
      K. Anything for you?

             JESSE
      Ill get the veganchilada with the 
      cashew cheese sauce on the side. Oh 
      can I look at the seaweed menu?

She hands him a tiny piece of recycled paper.


                                      57.
             JESSE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Oh. Awesome. You do have the Baltic 
      kelp today. Ill get that. Thanks.

             CELESTE
      Wow.

             JESSE
      How are you? You look great.

             CELESTE
      Thanks. 

She notices his feet.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Are you wearing...dress shoes?

             JESSE
      Oh yeah, theyre vegan.

Celeste could throw up.

             CELESTE
      You look good too.

             JESSE
      A lot of pilates. 

             CELESTE
      Huh, I didnt know you did pilates.

             JESSE
      Yeah, well, Veronicas a dancer and 
      has equipment at our house, so...

There is an uncomfortable beat.

             JESSE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Hows work?

             CELESTE
      Um...work is great.

             JESSE
      Good.

             CELESTE
      My book is getting great reviews. 
      Riley Banks is a new client which 
      is huge. Things are going really 
      well.


             JESSE      Great.

Long silence.

                                      58.

             JESSE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Listen, I know this has all been 
      pretty weird.

             CELESTE
      Its only weird if you think its 
      weird.

             JESSE
      Celeste, I never wanted to hurt 
      you.

             CELESTE
      Thank you. You didnt. Glad we 
      cleared that up.

             JESSE
      Look, I actually wanted to see you 
      because...apparently theres some 
      kind of hold up on your side with 
      the divorce papers and Veronicas 
      actually not a citizen so..

             CELESTE
      What? Wheres she from?

             JESSE
      Uh, Belgium.

             CELESTE
      (sotto) Huh. Belgium. Elegant.

             JESSE
      What?

             CELESTE
      Nothing.

             JESSE
      Point is, we need to...get married. 
      Im sorry.  I really need you to 
      sign those papers. 

             CELESTE
      Well, Jesse, Ive been busy with 
      work. Because some people work for 
      a living. So I havent really been 
      focused on what I can do to help 
      you get on with your new life.


                                      59.
             JESSE
      Im sorry. I know.

             CELESTE
      What makes you think you are even 
      suitable to be a dad?? You dont 
      even know how to read the electric 
      bill. How are you going to support 
      yourself? Have you even thought 
      this through? 

             JESSE
      I guess Ill have to figure it out.  
      Veronica is really supportive of my 
      work.

             CELESTE
      Really? Really Jesse? I paid the 
      rent for ten years.  If thats not 
      supportive, I dont know what is. 

             JESSE
      Thats true. And thank you.

There is a long pause.

             CELESTE
      We never even talked about kids.

             JESSE
      You had reservations about having 
      kids.

             CELESTE
      I had reservations about having 
      kids with YOU.

             JESSE
      Well, ditto. I think Veronica will 
      be a really good mother.

             CELESTE
      Low blow.

Celeste gets up from the table. She collects her things.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Ill sign the fucking papers. I  
      dont have time for this.  Youre 
      ridiculous, this place is 
      ridiculous. Fucking vegan kelp 
      cashew bullshit. What the fuck is 
      this place anyway.

      (she addresses the restaurant) Do 
      any of you have jobs?? Anyone? What 
      do you do? Wait, let me guess. You 
      grow pot. 

Celeste looks at an innocent bespectacled patron.

             RESTAURANT GUY
      Um, yeah. I do.

             CELESTE
      Exactly. Get a real job.

Celeste exits.

 
INT. CELESTES HOUSE HALLWAY-NIGHT

 
Celeste is in her robe about to get in the bath. She walks to 
the kitchen to grab a tea and walks by her office. The Ikea 
Robot catches her eye. She stops and enters the office.

                                  CUT TO:


INT. CELESTES OFFICE-A MOMENT LATER


Celeste stares at the robot. It stares back. She hates it. 
She kicks it. That hurt. She violently, with all her might, 
rips its head off. That felt good. She picks it up and starts 
to thrash the robot torso all over the room as, slowly, 
pieces of wood flail in every direction. Shes angry and out 
of control. She stops to catch her breath and sees what she 
has just done.  She falls to the ground in tears.


EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME-NIGHT


Celeste and Beth enter and survey the scene.  Beth is dressed 
like a little boy with a short brown wig, sunglasses and 
sneakers. Celeste is in a white trash bag with a belt. 

             CELESTE
      Jesses a fucking vegan?? 

             BETH
      A vegan whos soon to have his work 
      shown.  At the Gagosian.

             CELESTE
      The Gagosian?? Youre kidding. 
      What, the fucking clothespin thing? 
      When??

      Dont tell me actually...how did 
      anybody even know about his art, he 
      doesnt...I dont actually want to 
      know...god, hes on fire right now. 
      Breaking up with me was the best 
      thing that ever happened to Jesse.  
      I should break up with me.

             BETH
      Now, now.  Someone elses success 
      is not your demise, C.

             CELESTE
      Shut up.  Unless its Jesses.  Who 
      are dressed as again?

             BETH
      Beiber.

             CELESTE
      Ooh, he just got a buzzcut.

             BETH
      Really? Fuck.  When??

             CELESTE
      A couple hours ago. It was on 
      Perez.

             BETH
      Thats so sad.   His hair was 
      everything.

             CELESTE
      I need to fucking drink.

Two large dudes, one dressed as Peter Pan, the other as Snow 
White walk by.

             PETER PAN
      Were doing Car Bombs in the 
      kitchen. Wanna come?

             BETH
      Noooo.

pace.

             SNOW WHITE
      What are you?

             CELESTE
      What? Oh, White trash. 

Snow White is silent. Celeste points to her trash bag.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      White trash?

             SNOW WHITE
      (doesnt get it) Huh.

Paul (from yoga) enters to grab some ice from the freezer. He 
is wearing a black shirt covered in mini cereal boxes with 
plastic knives through them. Celeste is mid-Car Bomb and 
wasted.

             PAUL
      Celeste?

             CELESTE
      Yoga?

             PAUL
      Yeah, I havent seen you there for 
      a while. 

             CELESTE
      Ive been running a lot. Keeps you 
      in better shape.

             PAUL
      I can see thats important to you. 
      (referring to the Car Bomb in her 
      face)

Celeste is now drunk.

             CELESTE
      Hows your practice? (waving her 
      finger in his face, laughing)

             PAUL
      White trash?

      Uh huh. What are you?

      Um, a cereal killer, obviously.

             CELESTE
      Youre punny.

             PAUL
      By the way, you were right.

             CELESTE
      About what?

             PAUL
      About me. All of it, the car, the 
      phone, the yoga. Except that I did 
      go to an Ivy League school. 
      Cornell.

             CELESTE
      Barely an Ivy.

             PAUL
      I know.

             CELESTE
      Do you smoke?

             PAUL
      At parties.

      Me too. Lets go.

 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOME BACKYARD-NIGHT

 
Celeste and Paul sit away from the party, smoking cigarettes.

             PAUL
      (Playful) Sorry about that day at 
      the gym. I feel really open after 
      yoga...

             CELESTE
      Shhhh. Dont say open. Your 
      costumes great. Dont ruin it.

             PAUL
      Im kidding. I only go to yoga to 
      meet girls. Speaking of, whats the 
      deal with you and me? Is this 
      happening? Or...


                                      64.
             CELESTE
      My husband of six years wants a 
      divorce so he can marry the woman 
      whos carrying his child. Thats 
      the deal with you and me.

             PAUL
      Im sorry, that sounds tough.

             CELESTE
      Hes having a baby with a girl he 
      barely knows. Hes so lost. Hes 
      just going about it all...wrong.

             PAUL
      And youre right. Now what?

             CELESTE
      What do you mean?

             PAUL
      Well do you want to be right or do 
      you want to be happy? 

             CELESTE
      Listen, Yoga, I dont WANT to be 
      right, I AM right. People will let 
      you down. Ive accepted that fact, 
      but unfortunately, most of the 
      time, knowing that does keep you 
      from being happy.  But at least 
      its real.

             PAUL
      No one has ever given a more self-
      righteous monologue wearing only a 
      trash bag. Except for maybe the 
      homeless guy outside my dry 
      cleaners.

Beth and Tucker approach Celeste and Paul.

             BETH

                                      65.

 
Celeste is going through papers on her desk. Shes cleaning 
house. She sees the envelope from the divorce lawyer. She 
quickly tosses it aside. Then she comes across one of Jesses 
old notebooks. She flips through it. She reads a couple of 
sweet passages about her, it makes her smile. She grabs the 
phone.

             CELESTE
      Hey, its Celeste. You know, I 
      still have a bunch of your stuff in 
      the office. You should probably 
      grab it at some point. Okay.

She hangs up. She makes a decision. She grabs a box and 
starts throwing everything and anything in it that belongs to 
Jesse.

 
EXT. JESSE AND VERONICAS HOUSE-ECHO PARK-DUSK

 
Celeste carries a box of Jesses stuff to his front door.  
She doesnt knock. She leaves the box by the door. But she 
decides to keep the one journal with the sweet passages for 
herself; she deserves it and hell never know. She starts to 
walk away when she notices, its trash day.

                                  CUT TO:

 
INT. VERONICAS VOLKSWAGON BEETLE-DUSK

 
Jesse drives and Veronica is in the passenger seat. They are 
quiet and content. They look at each other and smile. After a 
beat:

             VERONICA
      Youre going to be a really good 
      dad.

             JESSE
      What? Why did you say that?

Veronica studies Jesses face.

             VERONICA
      I dont know, I just know it. 

             JESSE
      No ones ever said that to me.

EXT. JESSE AND VERONICAS DRIVEWAY-A MOMENT LATER

 
Three trash cans-green, brown, and blue-are lined up in the 
driveway.  A huge box is protruding from the blue can. 
Celeste considers. So much to be learned from the trash. She 
slowly walks over. She peeks in at the box; it has a big 
picture of a fancy stroller on the side of it. Crushing.

             CELESTE
      At least they recycle.


INT. VERONICAS VOLKSWAGON BEETLE-A MOMENT LATER


Veronica looks out the window.

             JESSE
      This is...so weird but I just 
      realized...whats your middle name? 
      I dont even know it.

They laugh a little.

             VERONICA
      Its um...Godelieve.

             JESSE
      Goldleaf?

             VERONICA
      No, Goldelieve. It means loved by 
      the Gods. Its Dutch.

             JESSE
      Sweet. Mines Mordechai.

             VERONICA
      What does it mean?

             JESSE
      Means Im really Jewish.

Veronica giggles. Theyre getting to know each other. Its 
awkward...but sweet.

EXT. JESSE AND VERONICAS SIDEWALK-ANOTHER MOMENT LATER

 
Celeste is still digging in the trash. She looks further 
down.

             CELESTE
      Guitar Hero?? Thats quite an 
      extravagant purchase for a 
      freelance writer and his elegant 
      Belgian bride.

All of a sudden, her diamond bracelet slips off her wrist and 
plunks to the bottom.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Shit. Shit shit shit.

She drops Jesses journal to the concrete and crawls into the 
trash can, still reaching for the bottom, not quite getting 
there. The trash can falls over with her in it. Just then, 
Jesses car pulls up and headlights shine on Celeste half-way 
in the trash can. She fumbles and then:

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Ow!!! Shit!

A piece of glass from the can has sliced her face. She 
immediately wiggles out of the trash can, stands it back up 
again. She looks for a place to run. Its too late. She picks 
up the journal and hides behind the trash cans but Jesse and 
Veronica have been watching her whole opera from the car. 
Jesse approaches a crouching Celeste.

             JESSE
      Celeste?

Celeste stands up slowly as if nothing is wrong. She is also 
holding Jesses journal close to her chest. 

             CELESTE
      Hey!

             JESSE
      What...are you doing?

             CELESTE
      I just...

She looks around to make an excuse.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Um...came over to drop off some of 
      your stuff.

             JESSE
      But why were you in the trash can?

             CELESTE
      I lost something.


                                      68.
             JESSE
      In the trash can?

             CELESTE
      My bracelet. It was a whole thing. 
      Its over now.

Jesse and Veronica just stare at Celeste for a long beat.

             JESSE
      Youve met Veronica, right?

             CELESTE
      Yes! Hi! Wow, youre so pregnant, 
      right! I love your sweater.

             VERONICA
      Oh. Thanks! (beat) Are you 
      bleeding?

             CELESTE
      What? Oh (she touches her cheek), 
      yeah, I guess I am.

             VERONICA
      Let me get you something for that.

             CELESTE
      NO. No, dont. Its fine, just a 
      little cut.

             VERONICA
      Are you sure? Im so sorry about 
      this.

             CELESTE
      No, Im sorry. So sorry. Well, Im 
      late for things. Have a good 
      afternight.

             VERONICA
      You sure you dont want to come in 
      for a drink?

             CELESTE
      Nooooo, no. Thats very nice but 
      no. Great to see you guys! Okay.

She starts to walk away with the journal.

             JESSE
      Is that mine?


                                      69.
             CELESTE
      Waht? Oh, yeah, thats weird. I 
      dont know how...here you go.

She laughs nervously and hands him his journal.  Celeste 
walks to her car. 


INT. POP FORM-CELESTES OFFICE- NEXT DAY


Celeste listen to her work messages on speakerphone as she 
Instant Messengers with Beth. Celeste writes I went through 
Jesses trash last night. Oh no.  Beth writes back, Im 
coming to your office right now.

             PAUL
	(V.O.)

      killer? Theres this yoga retreat 
      in Tulum that I just got an e-mail 
      about...uh, thats not why Im

EXT. POP FORM COURTYARD- 30 MINUTES LATER


Celeste and Beth eat lunch in the zen garden outside the Pop 
Form building. Celeste is picking at the end of her sandwich, 
recounting the waking nightmare of last night. The cut on her 
face is neatly bandaged.

             BETH
      You told her you liked her sweater? 
      What are you, twelve?

             CELESTE
      It was a disaster. But you should 
      have seen the sweater. So great. 
      Beth, am I losing my mind?

             BETH
      Maybe. No. Please no more trash-
      diving. Lets focus on you now.

             CELESTE
      This guys Paul keeps calling me but 
      I dont know...

             BETH
      C, you never know. Just go out with 
      him. It doesnt have to be 
      perfect...


             CELESTE      I met him at the gym.  Im not 
      meeting my husband at the gym. 

             BETH
      Just go. Nothing to lose.

                                      70.

INT. PHO SIAM THAI MASSAGE-NIGHT

 
Celeste is lying in a quiet, dark room in thai fisherman 
pants and a large t-shirt. She takes a deep breath. 

             CELESTE
      So where do you live?

We reveal that she is lying next to Paul, they are both about 
to get thai massages.

             PAUL
      Uh, I live in Westwood. In a condo.

             CELESTE
      Cool.

             PAUL
      You are gonna love this place. 
      Youve never felt so relaxed in 
      your life.

Cherry and Lucky enter, the masseuses. They all exchange 
quiet hellos and head nods. Cherry and Lucky get to work. 
Lucky takes Celestes leg and pushes it all the way over her 
head, not the most comfortable position.

             CELESTE
      Ahhhhh.(responding to the stretch) 
      Wow, this is a unique place to take 
      a date.

             PAUL
      Yeah, I take all my dates here.

             CELESTE
      I feel special.

             PAUL
      You are. They all are. 

Celeste giggles.  Paul takes a deep exhale as Cherry rams her 
elbow into his shoulderblade.


                                      71.
             PAUL
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      So how is being right about 
      everything going for you?

             CELESTE
      Not...that well. Ive been on a 
      real winning streak, so I thought 
      Id call you.

             PAUL
      You know what? Im happy you did.

At that moment, CRACK! Lucky has Celeste in a bear hug and it 
looks like she may have broken her back.

             CELESTE
      AHHHH! I dont know what your 
      definition of relaxing is but...

             PAUL
      Just wait. Trust me, you need this 
      right now.

 
EXT. PHO SIAM-NIGHT

 
Celeste and Paul exit. He has a huge smile on his face. She 
looks like shes in pain.

             CELESTE
      Why would you take me to a place 
      where Asian people beat you up? 
      That was absolute torture.

             PAUL
      But how do you feel?

Celeste takes a beat to see how she feels.

             CELESTE
      I feel great, actually.

             PAUL
      So shut up then.

             CELESTE
      Where are we going now?

             PAUL
      Dont try to control me. You need 
      to let go. In yoga, we call it 
      vairyaga.

He strikes a reverse triangle yoga pose in the parking lot.


             CELESTE      Oh my god, dont, with the yoga.

 
INT. DOWNTOWN CLUB-NIGHT

                                      72.

                                  CUT TO:

 
Celeste and Paul walk down stairs into an incredibly cool- 
looking speak easy. Teddy Pendegrass Love TKO is playing 
and people are dancing, actually dancing. No one is there to 
be seen, there is no pretention. 

             CELESTE
      This place is...really cool.

             PAUL
      You sound surprised.

             CELESTE
      I am, Westwood condo.

             PAUL
      Ill get us beers.

Celeste takes in the atmosphere for a moment. She is happy to 
be out. She takes her hair down, puts her hands through it, 
trying to look a little better.

             PAUL
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Hey!

Paul is on the dance floor, with two beers. Celeste meets 
him, takes her beer, and downs a third of it. Celeste looks 
up and Paul has started to dance. He looks at Celeste with 
jocular seduction. Hes actually not a bad dancer. Maybe hes 
good? Okay, no, hes great.  Paul pulls Celeste in and they 
dance together. Shes sort of embarrassed but shes having 
fun. Paul pulls away in a little spin and goes into a James 
Brown splits move. 

             CELESTE
      Ohh!!

Celeste is into it now. She dances around him, other people 
watch them. Paul pulls Celeste in close. Celeste kisses Paul 
quickly, to his surprise.

             PAUL
      What was that for?

             CELESTE
      Vairyaga, bro, let go. Not 
      everything has to have a reason.


They smile at each other.

Jesse, Skillz and Tucker with their arms up, cheering loudly.

 
EXT. FAIRFAX HIGH- CHEERLEADING PRACTICE-DUSK

 
Jesse, Skillz and Tucker are taking in a high school 
cheerleading practice, drinking tall boys and smoking cigs. 
Despite their ragtag appearance, do not be fooled...They are 
very loyal and knowledgable supporters. 

             SKILLZ
      Oooh...toe touch basket toss coming 
      up...degree of difficulty 9.  
      Gnarly.......nailed it! Way to go, 
      Becky!!!

Jesse is look at his iPhone. He is looking at Veronica and 
Jesse Baby Registry

             JESSE
      What the fuck is a Baby Bjorn?

             SKILLZ
      Its a very, very tiny Swedish man.

             TUCKER
      Its a baby carrier that allows 
      your child to benefit from parental 
      intimacy without the confinement of 
      a stroller. Duh.

             JESSE
      Why do you know that.

             TUCKER
      Beth.  We go to a lot of baby 
      showers.

             SKILLZ
      I put a lot of babies in the 
      ladies.

A parent of a cheerleader looks at trio with disgust. Jesse 
is still going through the registry list.


                                      74.
             JESSE
      Birthing towels, breast pump, 
      Diaper genie? Fuck, Im definitely 
      having a baby. (beat) Hows 
      Celeste?

             SKILLZ
      Shes...oh-kay. Im fine-tuning her 
      cannibus levels right now, just 
      trying to find the right balance. 

             JESSE
      Celeste doesnt smoke pot.

             SKILLZ
      She does now. She loves it.

Jesse takes this in.  Tucker changes the subject.

             TUCKER
      Hows Veronica?  Shes so sweet.

             JESSE
      Yeah, less sweet pregnant but its 
      probably just hormones.  

             TUCKER
      But are you into it?

             JESSE
      Yeah, I really like her.  She seems 
      great. For someone that I dont 
      really know thats having my baby.

California Love by Tupac (or whatever song we clear)  comes 
on and the cheerleaders start a routine.

             SKILLZ
      MY JAM!

Skillz stands up and starts breaking it down.  Hes not that 
good.  Committed though.  Jesse and Tucker continue to talk.

             TUCKER
      Are you scared?

             JESSE
      A little. Yes.

             TUCKER
      Thats great. You should be. Just 
      keep saying yes. Im really proud 
      of you.


Skillz looks at his cell phone. He shows Jesse a text from Celeste that reads, I need green. Now.

             SKILLZ
      Shes like my top client now.

                                      75.

 
INT. CELESTES HOUSE-LATE NIGHT

 
Celeste is home from her date with Paul and is now obsessing 
on Jesses Facebook page.  His status reads in a 
relationship. Shes drunk and this makes her sad. Oh, 
theres a video.  Its of Jesse and Veronica.  Jesse presents 
Veronica with a cake, she laughs and blows out the candles. 
They kiss. Crushing. Confusing.  Her doorbell rings.

INT. CELESTES HOUSE-A COUPLE MINUTES LATER

 
The door opens to reveal Skillz. He holds up a bag of weed.

             SKILLZ
      Step out of the shadows and into 
      the light. Are you crying?

             CELESTE
      I dont know what Im doing. Dating 
      is stupid and all of a sudden, my 
      ex-husband bakes cakes?  Its 
      probably fucking gluten-free.

             SKILLZ
      What?

             CELESTE
      Nothing. Can you just roll a joint 
      please?

Skillz rolls a tight joint.  

             SKILLZ
      Day by day, C.  You need not trip. 

Celeste takes a drag.

             CELESTE
      What are they like together?

             SKILLZ
      Who? Jesse and Veronica?


                                      76.
             CELESTE
      Yeah.

             SKILLZ
      You know, theyre oh-kay. Jesse is 
      trying.  Its not all rainbows and 
      unicorns but...

             CELESTE
      So hes not happy.

             SKILLZ
      I didnt say that.


INT. POP FORM CONFERENCE ROOM-NEXT DAY


Pop Form employees file out of a Riley Banks meeting.  Riley 
approaches Celeste.

             RILEY
      I really like the logo.

             CELESTE
      Oh, thank you. Yeah, I think its 
      perfect.

             RILEY
      The I.M. Pei influence is pretty 
      cool.

             CELESTE
      Wow, yeah, there is a little of 
      that happening. I.M. Pei. Huh.

             RILEY
      Are you mocking me?

             CELESTE
      No, Im just impressed that you 
      know anything about architecture.

             RILEY
      Why, because Im a pop star? You 
      know what your thing is?  Contempt 
      prior to investigation.

             CELESTE
      Im sorry?

             RILEY
      Youre convinced youre smarter 
      than everyone and THAT is your  
      dark little prison.


                                      77.

Riley smiles at Celeste, turns and leaves.

 
INT. CELESTES PRIUS-LATER

 
Celeste is still reeling from Rileys verbal undressing.

             CELESTE
      Dark little prison?? Bitch, what 
      does she know. You know whats a 
      dark little prison?? Having to wear 
      midriffs for a living. What does 
      she...

Celeste is pulling into her driveway and notices...Jesse, 
sitting on her porch, smoking a cigarette. 

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      What the fuck.


EXT. CELESTES HOUSE-A MOMENT LATER


Celeste cautiously walks up to her front door. Before she can 
speak, Jesse does.

             JESSE
      I started smoking again.

             CELESTE
      I can see that. That must go well 
      with your pilates.

Jesse looks sad and confused.

             JESSE
      I dont know what the rules are and 
      Im sure Im breaking them 
      but...god, I really miss you.

Celeste tries to digest this.

             CELESTE
      You want to come in?


INT. CELESTES HOUSE-AN HOUR LATER


They are in her living room on the couch, have a drink.

             JESSE
      Veronica is friends with the 
      assistant gallerist there and he 
      just really loved my stuff.  I 
      dont know, well see...

             CELESTE
      Jesse, thats great.  Im so happy 
      for you.

             JESSE
      Yeah, yeah. Its great.

Why doesnt he seem happier?  He knocks back the rest of the 
drink.

             JESSE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      I should probably get home.

             CELESTE
      Yeah.  Its really nice to see you.

He hugs her.  Tight.  They breathe together.  They hug 
tighter.  He pulls away, looks at her and kisses her for one 
second, very tenderly.  She pulls away.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      You should go.

             JESSE
      Can we just...lay here for a bit?

Celeste lays down and Jesse spoons behind her on the couch. 
They hold each other.  Theres a long drag of silence.  

             JESSE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      I cant believe Im having a 
      baby...and its not with you.

We see Celestes face but Jesse doesnt.  Shes crying.

 
INT. CELESTES LIVING ROOM- THE NEXT MORNING

 
The phone rings. Its early. Celeste, still in her clothes 
from the night before, wakes up. Jesse is gone.  She fumbles 
for the phone.

             CELESTE
      Yeah.

      Now.

 
INT. POP FORM OFFICES-LATE AFTERNOON

 
INSERT of a large, magnified version of Rileys RB logo. It 
is pretty clear what the image looks like. Scott stares at 
Celeste, waiting for her to freak out.

             CELESTE
      I dont see anything.

             SCOTT
      (referring to the logo) Its a 
      penis. And a butt.

             CELESTE
      What? Really? I dont see it.

             SCOTT
      You cant be serious. (points to 
      the logo) Theres the penis. And 
      theres the penis going into the 
      butt.

             CELESTE
      I think its a stretch.

             SCOTT
      Well, its not a stretch, Celeste.

Scott puts a DVD into the DVD player. A reel of news clips 
comes on.

             NEWSCASTER
      ...teenagers were hoping to get a 
      little bit of the teen stars 
      fashion magic but instead, they 
      have been suprised by what they 
      saw.

             PARENT
      Theres homosexual butt sex in the 
      logo. Does Riley think were that 
      stupid?? I will never support gay 
      marriage.

      from Pop Form-the marketing company 
      responsible-could be reached for 
      comment. 

Scott turns it off.

             SCOTT
      Celeste, what did you do.  How 
      could be so careless?

Celeste picks up the magnified logo again.

             CELESTE
      Oh. Oh my God. Oh wow, I totally 
      see it now. WOW. Ha. Haha. 
      Hahahahaaha.

Celeste starts laughing uncontrollably. Its the funniest 
thing shes ever seen.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Its a cock in a butt!!! 
      Hahahaahaaa!!

             SCOTT
      (fuming)Stop it. Stop laughing.

             CELESTE
      Scott, come on...

             SCOTT
      No, this is not a joke. Our 
      companys in serious danger. 

             CELESTE
      Youre being dramatic. 

             SCOTT
      Get out. I cant, with you, right 
      now. I have to deal with this. Ill 
      call you soon.

Her laughter fades and she exits the conference room.

Bon Ivers Skinny Love plays as Celeste walks slowly

the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

It is intercut with a montage of Super 8 footage of Celeste 
and Jesse in the past: At a seaside house, Jesse is 
reluctantly cutting a head off a fish to cook it, Celeste is 
repulsed but laughing. Celeste and Jesse cuddle in a sleeping 
bag, fighting off the cold. Celeste and Jesse take cover in a 
torrential New York City rain. They stand under an awning and 
she smiles as she runs her hand through his wet hair. Celeste 
is abruptly shaken out of her memories by a giant Chewbacca 
hugging her before she has a chance to stop him.

             CELESTE
      No...okay.

 
INT. THE WELL BAR-EARLY EVENING

 
We see Jesse sitting at the dive bar.  Celeste enters and 
sits next to Jesse.  She is happy to see him.

      Hey.

             JESSE
      We gotta talk.

             CELESTE
      I know. Thats why I called.

             JESSE
      Celeste...

             CELESTE
      Wait, let me say something.  I 
      dont know what happened last 
      night.  I dont know whats 
      happening with your other 
      situation. But I need to say this.  
      For the record, I fucked up. I was 
      cavalier about you. I took us for 
      granted. And I know this may sound 
      crazy but Id be remiss if I 
      didnt...if you were open to it...I 
      think that I could do better.  With 
      you. With us. If theres a chance 
      still...Id like to know.

Jesse cant even look at her.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Jesse?


                                      82.
             JESSE
      Im sorry. I cant.

Jesse gets up and leaves.

 
EXT. THE WELL BAR-EVENING

 
Jesse walks out of the bar. He takes a deep breath and starts 
walking. A beat later, Celeste tears out of the bar, walking 
quickly after Jesse.

             CELESTE
      Hey!

Jesse pauses for a moment. He turns.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Why did you come to my house last 
      night?

             JESSE
      I dont know.

             CELESTE
      Oh no, I think you do.

             JESSE
      I made a mistake. 

             CELESTE
      And?

             JESSE
      I shouldnt have come.

             CELESTE
      Youre a fucking coward. 

             JESSE
      Im just trying to do the right 
      thing with Veronica.  Im trying to 
      change. 

             CELESTE
      Well, you never changed for me.

Jesse pauses.

             JESSE
      To be honest, you didnt really let 
      me.


                                      83.
             CELESTE
      Wow.  All I did was wait for you to 
      grow up! I rooted for you, I 
      fucking paid for everything, I did 
      everything for you!

             JESSE
      Yeah, and I was never your equal. 
      And you know what? I think you 
      preferred it that way.

             CELESTE
      Right. Well, I know my success was 
      never easy for you.

             JESSE
      And how do you define success, 
      Celeste? Because you dont look 
      very successful right now.

             CELESTE
      And you are? Pretending to be a 
      father? Pretending to be an adult?  

             JESSE
      What do you want?

             CELESTE
      I just want you to admit that 
      youre wrong!

             JESSE
      Wrong? Wrong about what? What did 
      you want me to do? Wait for you to 
      meet someone first? Is that how you 
      saw it happening?

Celeste doesnt respond.

             JESSE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      I didnt expect to meet someone so 
      fast, but I did. And I think we 
      have a chance to be happy together.  
      I dont want to blow that.

             CELESTE
      You know what, Jesse? You 
      definitely will blow it.

Jesse takes a beat. It stings.

             JESSE
      I feel really sorry for you. You 
      might be alone forever.


                                      84.
He starts to walk away. Celeste call after him.

             CELESTE
      Dont ever call me. 

             JESSE
      Dont worry about it. 

Jesse walks away.

 
EXT. CELESTES GARDEN-NIGHT

 
Skillz and Celeste sit in her backyard and watch the last 
scene from Dirty Dancing. The image is being projected onto 
her garden wall.  There is no sound. Instead, Bob Marleys 
Kaya plays over the speakers. Celeste is ripping an 
enormous bowl from a four-foot bong. Skillz is on his knees, 
bracing the bong, looking at Celeste with admiration. Celeste 
watches the movie. 

             CELESTE
      Shes so sad.

             SKILLZ
      Is she? I dont think so.

             CELESTE
      No, shes sad. I can tell. I went 
      to dance camp.

We see Jennifer Grey elevated above Patrick Swayze, looking 
elated. Celeste exhales a huge billow of smoke.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Thats the first good thing thats 
      happened to me in months. 

             SKILLZ
      Shitll get better.

             CELESTE
      Will it? You dont know that. 

Celeste grabs a handful of Cheetos from an economy-sized bag.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      How could he do this to me?

             SKILLZ
      J-Thunder? Hes not doing anything 
      to you. You wanted a divorce.


                                      85.
             CELESTE
      But I didnt want it like this.

             SKILLZ
      When we are no longer able to 
      change a situation, we are 
      challenged to change ourselves.

             CELESTE
      Huh?

             SKILLZ
      Oh. Its Victor Frankl.

             CELESTE
      Huh.

Skillz gets up.

             SKILLZ
      I gotta go before Petco closes.

             CELESTE
      You have a pet?

             SKILLZ
      No, but I gotta get a toy for this 
      girls cat, you know, so shell 
      give up the kitty.

             CELESTE
      Can I come?

             SKILLZ
      No.

             CELESTE
      Will you bring me some Panda 
      Express?

             SKILLZ
      No.

             CELESTE
      Do you think the Obamas are really 
      in love?

             SKILLZ
      Yes. Enough questions. Ill pick 
      you up at noon.

             CELESTE
      Noon?


             SKILLZ      Beth and Tuckers pre-wedding BBQ? 

             CELESTE
      Right, right.

             SKILLZ
      Hey, easy on the herb until then. 
      That shit is powerful.

                                      86.

                                  CUT TO:


EXT. BETH AND TUCKERS BACKYARD-DAY


Celeste is sitting alone, wearing sunglasses, and 
uncharacteristically colorful clothes that dont match.  Like 
a crazy lady jumpsuit.  She is going to town on a HUGE plate 
of food: chicken wings, fries, burger, hot dog, coleslaw, egg 
salad and a beer. She attacks it like its her last meal 
ever. Shes also trashed. Celeste gets up and heads towards a 
group of people talking including, Beths mom, Beth and a 
couple of her girlfriends.

             BETH
      Hi honey, you remember Eileen 
      from...

             CELESTE
      Do you have any more of that ranch 
      dressing? Its the fucking 
      booooooomb.

Beth is embarrassed. Celeste gives Beths mom, CAROL, 60, 
very large, a big sloppy hug.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Hi Carol! Beths getting married! I 
      was married, remember? These guys 
      are in for a fucking dogfight, 
      right?

Beth pulls Celeste away.

             BETH
      Lets get you a soda.

They get to the bar.

             CELESTE
      Do you guys have any tequila?

             BARTENDER
      We only have Mimosas and Shandys.


                                      87.
             CELESTE
      Ill have both please.

Beth pulls Celeste away from the bar and brings her into the 
house and plops her down on the couch.

             BETH
      Im going to recommend some quiet 
      time for you right now.

             CELESTE
      Can I smoke?

             BETH
      No.

Celeste starts weeping.

             CELESTE
      I dont want to be alone forever.

             BETH
      Not forever, honey. Just until you 
      sober up. Youll be fine.

             CELESTE
      Okay then, Ill just go to the 
      other side of the pool. I promise I 
      wont make you look bad.

 
EXT. BETH AND TUCKERS POOL-LATER

 
Jesse and Veronica are talking to Beth. In the foreground, 
Celeste slowly floats into frame on a raft in the pool, 
passed out, face down, sunglasses half off, fully clothed. 
Skillz approaches Beth.

                                  CUT TO:

             BETH
      At least shes quiet now.

             SKILLZ
      Im gonna get her out of here.


INT. BETHS DUPLEX- HANCOCK PARK- NEXT DAY


Beth has tons of Barneys New York bags and is trying on 
clothes for her rehearsal dinner.  Celeste is in the fetal 
position, hungover on Beths bed.


                                      88.
             CELESTE
      (on the phone) Hey Riley, its 
      Celeste.  I just want to talk to 
      you about this error in your 
      logo.  Im so, so sorry, I will fix 
      this...call me.

             BETH
      I just think its corny to wear 
      white two nights in a row.  I want 
      to rock a pattern, or maybe 
      something in pastel...

She turns to Celeste in a dress.

             BETH
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Hows this?  C! Wake up! Im 
      leaving in an hour and I have to 
      make a decision now.  You owe me.  
      You humped my grandmother 
      yesterday.

Celeste is comatose.

             BETH
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Oh no, are you okay?

             CELESTE
      What the fuck does Riley Banks 
      know. 

             BETH
      Um...nothing. Shes a tart.

             CELESTE
      Yeah dude! Shes fucking moderately 
      talented, blessed with a good face 
      and has maybe 5 more years left of 
      stardom.  Who is she to tell ME 
      what...

Celeste looks at her blackberry and realizes she never hung 
up on Riley.  Oh shit. She hangs up quick and throws the 
blackberry across the bed.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      I never hung up, I never hung up! 
      Fuck! Do you think she...

Her blackberry rings. Its Riley. She takes a deep breath. 
She picks, all casual.


             CELESTE	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Hey Riley, whats up?

             RILEY
      I need to talk to you.  Come to my 
      house. Now.

             CELESTE
      Oh boy.

                                      89.

                                  CUT TO:


INT. RILEYS HOUSE- HOLLYWOOD HILLS-AFTERNOON


Celeste bursts in with all types of nervous energy.

             CELESTE
      The thing is, I have been having a 
      really hard time in my life, 
      everything is sort of falling apart 
      and when you said that thing about 
      contempt and investigation, it just 
      sort of hit a nerve and...

             RILEY
      Just, shut up for a minute.

Riley is in tears.

             RILEY
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      I just found out my boyfriend 
      cheated on me. 

             CELESTE
      Oh. God, Im sorry. I didnt even 
      know you had a boyfriend.

             RILEY
      Nobody knew. He didnt want anybody 
      to know. Fucking ass hole.  And 
      now, my career might be over 
      because you put a penis in my logo.  
      Thank you for that.

Riley is clearly destroyed.

             RILEY
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      I didnt know who to call.

Celeste gives Riley a big hug.


             CELESTE      So you called the smartest person 
      you know.

Riley smiles through her tears.

                                      90.

                                  CUT TO:

 
INT. RILEYS HOUSE- HOLLYWOOD HILLS-LATER THAT NIGHT

 
Riley is asleep on the couch with a blanket over her.  
Celeste is up, watching Great Sports Moments of 2008 on 
ESPN Classic.

It is a recap of Matthias Steiners Olympic weight lifting 
triumph after his wife died. Jesses favorite. Celeste is 
crying. This wakes Riley up.

             RILEY
      Are you crying?

Celeste turns off the television.

             CELESTE
      Oh, yeah, this just reminds me of 
      someone. 

             RILEY
      A guy?

             CELESTE
      Yeah. A guy.

             RILEY
      You miss him?

             CELESTE
      Yeah, I do.

             RILEY
      They all fucking suck.

             CELESTE
      Kind of.

             RILEY
      So it never gets better?

             CELESTE
      No, it doesnt. But you do. Youre 
      gonna be fine.


 INT. DRY CLEANERS-MORNING

                                      91.

 
Celeste is runs into a dry cleaners.  She is out of breathe. 
The long line of impatient people to see this dragon breather 
who has broke the silence.  She looks at her watch.  She 
stands diligently in line.

Celestes phone rings loudly.  She picks it up.

             CELESTE
      Hi...I know I wont...no Im on the 
      road already!  Near...Bakersfield?  
      Of course Ill be there...love you 
      too.

She hangs up and was clearly lying.  She must do something.  
Something she does not want to do.  She looks at the stoic 
woman in front of her.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Im so sorry but I am the maid of 
      honor and I am supposed to be at 
      the wedding real far away, would 
      you mind if I just got in front of 
      you?... 

The woman reluctantly waves her to pass.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Thank you so much, I really do 
      appreciate...sir?

A disinterested man barely acknowledges Celeste.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Im incredibly late for this 
      wedding and my dress is here, is 
      there any way...

He moves aside.  The next man just stares at her.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Hi. Im sure you heard me ask the 
      last guy but...

The camera pulls out.  A wide shot of Celeste, imprisoned by 
her own rules, asking every person to cut.  It looks tedious 
and ridiculous.

Its Paul. Again. She pushes Ignore. 

                                  CUT TO:


                                      92.
 
INT. CAR-DAY

Celeste chain smokes.  She makes up songs about how shitty 
the traffic is.  She laughs uncontrollably.  She just 
screams.

 
INT. DELI-BIG SUR-LATE AFTERNOON

 
 
Celeste sits at a window counter. She looks out onto a small 
street in the center of town. She unwraps her sandwich from 
noisy, wax paper. Its really quiet in the deli. She sees a 
group of wedding guests outside. They wave. She waves back.

 
INT. RECEPTION TENT-EARLY EVENING

 
The wedding is under way.

             PRIEST
      I now pronounce you husband and 
      wife. 

Tucker and Beth kiss. Everybody explodes in applause. We see 
Celeste in the audience, clapping.  She looks beat down and 
tired. 

 
INT. RECEPTION TENT-NIGHT

                                  CUT TO:

 
Three girls, with no stage presence, are giving a speech. 
They are trading off rhyming couplets. 

             GIRL #1
      She pursued her love of Spanish 
      men, but missed her Tucker, more 
      than just as a friend.

             GIRL #2
      And our princess returned home to 
      her loving prince, and theyve been 
      together ever since.

             ALL THREE GIRLS
      We love you, Bethy!!

The audience applauds. Celeste rolls her eyes. 

             GIRL #2
      And now were gonna hear from 
      Celeste, Beths best friend in the 
      world.


A little more applause. Celeste has completely forgotten she was supposed to speak. Oh no. She gets up slowly and grabs 
the mike. 

                                      93.

             CELESTE
      Thank you. Thanks a lot, girls, 
      that was so...wow. There are no 
      words. Well, this is gonna sound 
      bad but I actually forgot that I 
      was speaking tonight. 

Beth looks at her, frozen.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      I dont where to start. Um...how do 
      you get a nun pregnant? You fuck 
      her? 

Beths father laughs uncontrollably. Hes the only one 
laughing.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Thanks, Tom. Man, it was much 
      longer than I thought to get to Big 
      Sur from Los Angeles on a Friday 
      afternoon. Stellar call on having a 
      destination wedding the weekend 
      before 4th of July.  Busiest travel 
      day of the year. So thanks for 
      that, Mrs. Weinberg. 

Wedding guests look uncomfortable.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      But the truth is, I would go 
      anywhere for Beth. Shes my best 
      friend. And Im so happy for her. 
      Senior year of college, we had a 
      tradition. Every Sunday, come rain 
      or shine, Beth and Tucker would 
      meet me and Jesse at the Bishop 
      with a 12-pack of Miller High Life, 
      the champagne of beers, and we 
      would meet to talk about what was 
      important in the world, you know, 
      Heideggers influence on hip-hop. 
      Or the feminist duality on Melrose 
      Place. Lifes big questions. Beth 
      and Tucker were just friends then 
      but there was always something 
      there. Just an ease they had with 
      each other. Jesse and I spent years 
      trying to get them together, 
      unsuccessfully. 


                                      94.
             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      But we all remained friends and 
      watched as Tucker dated the most 
      slutty, vacuous and vile girls on 
      the planet.  For five long years. 

Tucker flinches.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Finally, he removed his head from 
      his ass, and saw what was in front 
      of him. And that was beautiful 
      Beth. And none of us could be 
      happier about it; they were 
      perfect. At last. Love wins.

Wedding guests clap.  They think its over. Its not.  
Celeste looks at Jesse in the crowd.  Veronica is next to 
him.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Um...Jesse and I are getting a 
      divorce. So thats...yeah, our 
      timing was not as good, I guess. 
      Beth and Tucker, you are lucky to 
      be best friends. Work hard and 
      respect that. It doesnt come 
      easily. Be patient, dont always 
      think youre right. And if you are, 
      it doesnt fucking matter anyway. 
      Fight for it, everyday, I wish I 
      had.


EXT. RECEPTION TENT-AN HOUR LATER


Celeste is holding a small plate of food. Jesse sidles up to 
her.

             JESSE
      I know this may not the best time 
      to talk about this...but...at some 
      point, we will have to talk about 
      Tuckers dance moves.

INSERT of Tucker dancing on the dance floor.  Its 
unexplainable. Its shocking how terrible it is.

             CELESTE
      He is so special. Not as special as 
      that poem. That those girls did? 

	       JESSE
	Wow.

		CELESTE
	Wow.



                                      95.
He takes a beat.

             JESSE
      Your speech was really...beautiful. 
      Thank you.

             CELESTE
      I meant it.

             JESSE
      I know.

             CELESTE
      You know what else is beautiful?

Celeste picks up a baby gerkin from her plate and starts to 
jerk it off, as she and Jesse did earlier and as they have 
done many times.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Oh god, tug it.

Jesse starts to participate. He dips his finger in the creme 
fraiche and puts it on the top of the gerkin.

             JESSE
      Aw yeah! Fuck!

Jesse and Celeste are in hysterics.  Just then, Veronica 
arrives. 

             VERONICA
      Jesse?

             JESSE
      Hey.

Celeste and Jesse stop like two children who just got caught.

             VERONICA
      What are you doing?

             JESSE
      What? Nothing. Were just...

He looks at Celeste for cover. She is giddy, wasted and happy 
to explain.

             CELESTE
      Oh, Jesse and I do this thing where 
      we find the littlest thing that 
      resembles a penis and we just, you 
      know...


Celeste and Jesse demonstrate for Veronica. Celeste looks up and realizes how dumb this must seem.

                                      96.

             VERONICA
      I dont get it.

Celeste and Jesse stop.  

             CELESTE
      Its stupid.

Veronica is looking at Celetes food.

             VERONICA
      Oh, the foods out. (to Celeste) See 
      you on the dance floor?  Watch out 
      for Tucker though.

They leave Celeste, standing alone, smiling. She bites into 
the carrot.

 
INT. WEDDING TENT-LATER

 
We see a raucous wedding dance floor.  Everyones dancing: 
Beth, Tucker, their families, their friends, Jesse, Veronica, 
Scott, etc. They are doing wedding dances.  Celeste sits at 
her table, watching with a smile.  It is bittersweet for her.  
She drinks a martini.  Alone.


INT. PAULS CONDO-NIGHT


Celeste and Paul are playing scrabble and drinking wine. 

             PAUL
      (keeping score on a notepad) So, 
      thats 38 points plus 50 bonus 
      points for using all my tiles so...

             CELESTE
      Wait, wait, wait. I think I may 
      have to challenge. Zooecia?? Thats 
      not a word, thats my hoochie 
      cousins name!

             PAUL
      Are you challenging or not?

             CELESTE
      Yes, I definitely am.


                                      97.
             PAUL
      Well, I will tell you that Zooecia 
      is a sac secreted by a compound 
      organism but here you go. (he hands 
      her the Scrabble dictionary) Look 
      for yourself.

Celeste finds the word, reads the definition and silently 
accepts defeat.

             PAUL
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Ha ha! I go again.

             CELESTE
      Ive never lost a game of Scrabble 
      in my life.

             PAUL
      Well, nothing lasts forever.


INT. PAULS LIVING ROOM- LATER


Celeste and Paul are making out on the couch.

             PAUL
      Im so sorry I beat you in 
      Scrabble.

             CELESTE
      No youre not.

             PAUL
      Youre right, Im not.

The making out gets a little hotter. Celeste is aggressive.

             CELESTE
      Will you get a condom?

             PAUL
      Uh...I dont think we should...

             CELESTE
      No, youre using a condom.

             PAUL
      No, I dont think we should sleep 
      together.

Celeste pulls away from him.

             CELESTE
      What?


                                      98.
             PAUL
      I just...I dont know.

             CELESTE
      Are you not into it?

             PAUL
      No, no believe me, Im into it. 

             CELESTE
      Then, whats the deal?

             PAUL
      I really like you.

             CELESTE
      Right, Im confused...why not sleep 
      with me then?

             PAUL
      Because I think I might really like 
      you.

             CELESTE
      Oh. (further realizing) Oh. Okay. 
      Well, I like you too.

Celeste looks distant.

 
INT. L.A. NIGHTCLUB-NIGHT

 
Celeste is at a loud, trendy club.  She sits next to Riley. 
They have to shout to be heard.

             RILEY
      THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE MOST 
      EMBARRASSING SPEECH EVER! HOW WILL 
      SHOW YOUR FACE TO YOUR FRIENDS EVER 
      AGAIN?

             CELESTE
      ACTUALLY, WEIRDLY, IM KINDA HAPPY 
      I DID IT.  I FEEL BETTER SOMEHOW.

             RILEY
      WELL GOOD FOR YOU THEN. 

Celeste looks around at lots of men, grinding each other with 
whistles in their mouth and drinks in their hands.

             CELESTE
      THE GAYS REALLY KNOW HOW TO PARTY, 
      HUH?


                                      99.
             RILEY
      WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

Celeste just looks at her like, Oh you poor, sheltered 
Disney princess. Are you serious?

             CELESTE
      THIS IS A GAY CLUB.

             RILEY
      ITS OPENING NIGHT HERE. IT DOESNT 
      KNOW WHAT IT IS YET.

Still nothing from Riley.

             CELESTE
      RILEY, THE CLUB IS CALLED SWALLOW.

Riley looks around and takes it in. Aha, right.  Celeste 
looks out amongst the crowd. Just then, two beefy, waxed, 
tanned, well-groomed gay men walk up to Celeste.

             GAY MAN
      Excuse me, can you please tell your 
      friend Riley that we worship her??

             GAY MAN #2
      OMG, shes so pretty!

             CELESTE
      Sure...

Celeste notices that they are both wearing the Riley Banks t-
shirts, made for pre-teens, with the cock-in-the-butt mistake 
in the logo. She points at it.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Wait, are you aware that the logo 
      is...

             GAY MAN #2
      A dick in a butt? Yeahhh!

             GAY MAN
      Its amazing. All of our friends 
      are rocking it. Its like the gay 
      Izod.

The gay man points to a group of his friends on the dance 
floor, ALL wearing Riley Banks gear, some of them have even 
made their own t-shirts with the cock in the butt logo 
magnified.


                                     100.
             CELESTE
      Wow, so, what, you just buy the 
      biggest size they make?

             GAY MAN
      How dare you, Im a size in 
      tween. I have a slight frame.

They walk away, offended.  Celeste turns to Riley.  She is 
being adored by gay men.

             RILEY
      I LOVE IT HERE!!

Celeste has a big idea.

 
EXT. RUNYON CANYON-MORNING

 
Celeste is hiking alone on the phone, energized.

             CELESTE
      Tweens dont want her anymore.  But 
      the gays do! Ten percent of 
      Americans are gay, Scott.  Youre 
      gay, start thinking gay.  Gay Izod. 
      She could be Lady Gaga by the end 
      of the year. Huge market.

             SCOTT
      Wow, you might have just turned the 
      cock in the butt around.

             CELESTE
      We WILL make the cock in the butt 
      work for us. The cock in the butt 
      will be huge!

Just then, a mom and two small children walk by her, overhear 
her dirty mouth and glare at her. She waves at them self-
consciously.

INT. TARGET-AFTERNOON

 
Celeste is shopping for a dresser. She is talking to a 
salesperson.

             SALESMAN
      So, it comes with directions and 
      its actually really easy to 
      assemble.

             CELESTE
      Look, you do not know me. I do not 
      want to assemble. Trust me, you do 
      not want me to assemble. Bad things 
      happen. Could I just take the floor 
      model? Ill hook you up.

             SALESMAN
      Lemme go ask my manager.

             CELESTE
      Thanks, dude.

Celeste is browsing and spots Veronica with a shopping cart 
filled with baby stuff. She approaches her.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Veronica? Hey, Celeste.

             VERONICA
      Of course, yeah, hi! What are you 
      doing?

             CELESTE
      Oh, Im getting a dresser. You?

             VERONICA
      Oh, you know getting...

   		VERONICA
	(CONTD)
	Baby stuff.

		CELESTE
	Baby stuff.

             VERONICA
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Beth is uh...throwing me a baby 
      shower? So I have to register.


                                     102.
             CELESTE
      She is?

Celeste swallows this.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Thats uh...really nice.

             VERONICA
      Very. And so helpful right now.

             CELESTE
      Of course. (laughs nervously) Well, 
      looks like youre really organized. 

             VERONICA
      Organized, terrified.

             CELESTE
      Youll do great.

             VERONICA
      Thanks. I hope so.

They share an awkward moment.

             VERONICA
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Listen, I never got a chance to 
      just tell you Im so sorry about 
      all this. Trust me, I didnt 
      expect...

             CELESTE
      No, dont. Really. Theres nothing 
      to apologize for. Im the one whos 
      sorry. I mean, I dug through your 
      trash.

Celeste laughs.

             VERONICA
      Look, I dont blame you. For 
      anything. This has all been so 
      weird. Everything happened really 
      fast. 

             CELESTE
      Yeah, it did. But everything will 
      work out. I know it.  Jesses book 
      is coming out...

             VERONICA
      Hes so talented.


                                     103.
A beat.

             CELESTE
      Yeah, he is.

An awkward silence.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Well, good luck. Nice to see you.

             VERONICA
      You too.

They both steer their carts towards each other in opposite 
directions but bump right into each other.

             CELESTE
      Oh sorry!

             VERONICA
      Oh, its okay! Bye again.

 
INT. ROSEN KARAOKE-KOREATOWN- LATER THAT NIGHT

 
Celeste and Paul are in a private karaoke room. Paul is 
belting his heart out, singing Boyz II Men, On Bended Knee. 
Celeste is loving it. She has her own mike and pipes in once 
in a while with a harmony.

             PAUL
      Can somebody tell me how to get 
      things back the way they used to 
      be...oh God give me a reason, Im 
      down on bended knee..ooohohhh ooooh

             CELESTE
      Ooohh ohhh. Til you come back to 
      me..

             PAUL
      Im down on bended knee hee hee 
      hee.

They finish with a huge applause for themselves and toast 
with beers.

             PAUL
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      I think were really good.

             CELESTE
      No, we ARE really good.


Celeste punches in the numbers for the next song. Its Islands in the Stream, made popular by Kenny Rogers and 
Dolly Parton.

                                     104.

             PAUL
      Aw shit!

             CELESTE
      Get ready. Youre first.

             PAUL
      Baby when I met you, there was 
      peace on earth, I set out get you 
      with a fine tooth comb. I was soft 
      inside. Soft inside? What the fuck?

             CELESTE
      Shhh come on. Focus.

             PAUL
      You do something to me, that I 
      cant explain, hold me closer, and 
      I feel no pain. Tender love is 
      blind, it requires a dedication.

Celeste and Paul sing in harmony.

      		CELESTE
	Honest love, we feel, needs 
	conversation. And we ride it 
	it together, uh huh...

		PAUL
	Honest love, we feel, needs 
	conversation. And we ride it 
	it together, uh huh...

Celeste slowly drops her mike. Paul is still singing.

             CELESTE
      (quietly) I cant.

             PAUL
      What? Come on, were so good 
      together. Islands in the stream, 
      that is what we are. Get in there!! 
      This is my favorite part!

             CELESTE
      No. I cant.

             PAUL
      I know Im pitchy but Im finding 
      it. Sail away with me...

             CELESTE
      No. This. Us. Im sorry.

Paul slowly drops his mike.


                                     105.
             PAUL
      What do you mean?

             CELESTE
      I just...cant.

             PAUL
      Are you serious? Oh no. Why?

He sits down on the couch. The music is still playing in the 
background.

             CELESTE
      I think I need to be alone? Im not 
      ready. Im having fun and I feel 
      like Im beginning to like you and 
      I just dont think Im ready for 
      that.

             PAUL
      What? Really? 

Celeste doesnt say anything.

             PAUL
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Wow, youre breaking my heart.

             CELESTE
      Im so sorry. You are so...great. 
      But Im getting divorced. 

             PAUL
      Celeste, I know.

             CELESTE
      I think I need to go through this 
      alone.

             PAUL
      Yeah. Yeah, okay. I respect that. 
      Live by will, not by force.

             CELESTE
      What?

             PAUL
      Youre only ready when youre 
      ready, you know? Dont force it. 
      Its just some yoga shit.

             CELESTE
      Thanks.


                                     106.
             PAUL
      But I do like you. I like you a 
      lot.  And when you are ready, if 
      youre ready, call me.

 
INT. STEIN, WEINBERG, STEINBERG & JIMENEZ LAW FIRM - 
AFTERNOON

 
Celeste and Jesse sit across from each other with their 
respective lawyers.  They are both dressed very well.  The 
atmosphere is formal, tense. There is not a lot of talking 
but there is a lot of loud paper shuffling and ball point 
pens.  CELESTES LAWYER, male, 40, speaks:

             CELESTES LAWYER
      Sign here. And here. And here.

Celeste looks up, makes eye contact with Jesse and smiles 
uncomfortably.

             CELESTES LAWYER
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      And here. Here. Yup.  Aaaaaand 
      here. Here.  Couple more. Here...

Celeste is still signing. She looks at Jesse again, who is 
straightening his tie.

             CELESTE
      I like that tie.

             JESSE
      Oh, thank you.

             CELESTES LAWYER
      One more here.

             CELESTE
      Is it made out of organic mung 
      beans?

Jesse nods and chuckles. 

             JESSE
      No, I actually found it digging 
      through your trash.

             CELESTE
      Ohhh, I see. All right. 

Theyve broken the tension.  But its still silent. Then 
Jesse chortles.  It sounds like a baby pig.  It makes Celeste 
laugh.  


Now, both Celeste and Jesse are silently cracking up, doubled over as their lawyers sit there, watching them, perplexed.

                                     107.

 
EXT. STEIN, WEINBERG, STEINBERG & JIMENEZ LAW FIRM -         
 A LITTLE LATER

Celeste and Jesse walk out of the building. 

             JESSE
      So...were divorced!

They high five. What are you supposed to do when you get 
divorced.

             CELESTE
      We did it.

             JESSE
      You wanna walk for a couple 
      minutes?

             CELESTE
      Sure.


EXT. LACMA- SUNDOWN

                                  CUT TO:


Celeste and Jesse are now approaching the front of Urban 
Light, the installation from the beginning of the movie.  
The street lamps are now illuminated. She takes a seat on a 
step. Jesse sits next to her. She refers to the lamps:

             CELESTE
      These are beautiful.

             JESSE
      I thought you hated them.

             CELESTE
      Yeah, well, Ive never seen them at 
      night. 

Jesse looks at the lamps and takes them in.  He looks pretty 
sad.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Whats up with you?  I know we just 
      got divorced but no one died, 
      right?


                                     108.
             JESSE
      Im just feeling like maybe you 
      were right.  I am a fuck up. I 
      dont know what Im doing.  My 
      girlfriend left. 

There is a long pause.

             CELESTE
      What? Veronica? Left where?

             JESSE
      Left me. She wanted me to tell her 
      everything was gonna be okay and I 
      couldnt. I dont know why but I 
      just...couldnt. She wants to go 
      back to Brussels.

Another monumental pause. Jesses eyes start tearing up.

             JESSE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Okay, you can say it now. You were 
      right, I blew it. Just say it.

             CELESTE
      Hey...dont do that.

             JESSE
      Do what?

             CELESTE
      You are not a loser. You never 
      were. You took a chance.  I admire 
      that and I believe in you.

             JESSE
      You do?

             CELESTE
      I do. And I want to thank you.

             JESSE
      For what?

             CELESTE
      For never being the person I wanted 
      you to be.

             JESSE
      Oh, youre welcome.

             CELESTE
      Go get her. 


                                     109.
             JESSE
      But I dont know if everything is 
      gonna be all right.

             CELESTE
      Well, who does? Do you love her?

Jesse looks at Celeste.

             JESSE
      I do.

             CELESTE
      Then its worth fighting for.

             JESSE
      Okay. Okay.

Celeste smiles with tears in her eyes.

             CELESTE
      God, I finally understand why you 
      fucking cry all the time. Shit is 
      emotional.

They share a laugh. Then, they sit in silence for a beat.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      You deserve to be happy. And I wish 
      that for you, always.

             JESSE
      Me too.

             CELESTE
      So...I guess we were right.

             JESSE
      Huh?

Celeste makes the C and J hand gesture from the high school 
photo in the opening montage. Jesse makes it back. They 
smile. 

             JESSE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      I love you.

He kisses her on the lips. For the last time. And then, hes 
gone.

             CELESTE
      I love you too.


                                     110.
Celeste sits awhile and looks up at the sky.

 
INT. CELESTES PRIUS- NEXT DAY

Celeste drives and dials a number on her bluetooth.

             CELESTE
      Hey. So, youre probably giving 
      your card to some girl in yoga 
      right now. But if that doesnt work 
      out for you...I think I may be 
      ready. To beat you in Scrabble. 


EXT. GAS STATION- A MOMENT LATER

Celeste runs in to pay for gas. She is on her Blackberry.


INT. GAS STATION MART

 


Celeste stands in line with some gum and water. A young man 
blatantly cuts in front of her with a gallon of water. Old 
Celeste returns for a moment.

             CELESTE
      Excuse me, sir?

The young man turns around. Celeste realizes shes no longer 
this person. She restrains herself.

             CELESTE
	(CONTD) (CONTD)
      Nothing.

Celeste takes in how she has changed. She smiles a little. 
The young man turns back to her.

             YOUNG MAN
      Hey, Im sorry for cutting. My 
      dogs in the car and hes really 
      thirsty. So, thanks.

             CELESTE
      No problem.

She smiles again. The world feels bigger now.

                                 FADE OUT
