FADE IN:

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

OPENING CREDITS and MUSIC play as dawn breaks over the
city by the bay.  Sounds of intense SEXUAL EXERTION FADE
UP.

INT. NELSON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

In what is more workout than lovemaking, NELSON MOSS (36)
thrusts vigorously into ANGELICA (32), lying spread-
eagled on her back.  An ALARM goes off, and on cue,
Nelson climaxes.  OPENING CREDITS and MUSIC FADE OUT.

Finished, Nelson hops to his feet on his way...

                 NELSON
       That was good...

Ambivalent, Angelica watches as Nelson enters the
bathroom.

                 NELSON
       Top dog, big dog, bad dog...

INT. NELSON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

Nelson showers.

                 NELSON
       Who's the best dog?  It's my dog.

INT. NELSON'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY

Towel-wrapped, Nelson keeps talking as he crosses the
room.

                 NELSON
       It's the big, bad dog.

Angelica pulls on her underwear as she watches Nelson
exit.

INT. NELSON'S APARTMENT - LIVING AREA - DAY

The penthouse is orderly and stark.  Entering, Nelson
grabs an incoming fax, turns on a coffeemaker and picks
up a remote control.  Ignoring a stunning view of the
city, he closes the blinds and turns ON FIVE TELEVISIONS.

Fax in hand, Nelson speed-dials on a cell phone as he
passes Angelica.  Entering a walk-in closet, he dresses
in a hurry.

                 NELSON
       Number one dog, dog at the top --

                 ANGELICA
       Slow down.  We need to talk.

       Vince?

                 NELSON

                 VINCE (V.O.)
            (over phone)
       How about those Vitagirl numbers?

                 NELSON
            (into phone)
       Yeah, looking good.
            (to Angelica, fake
             innocent)
       Talk about what?

He sees the look on her face, turns his head, rolls his
eyes and mouths "us" as she says:

       Us.

                 ANGELICA

He mouths "shit," then turns to flash her a reassuring
smile, holding up a finger to wait as he finishes his
call.

                 VINCE (V.O.)
       We're T-minus 72 hours from fast
       food fame or oblivion.  Ready to
       sign off on this copy?

Nelson makes an apologetic face to Angelica, uses work to
avoid dealing with her, hurries into the living room.

                 NELSON
       Almost.  Meet you in twenty.

INT. NELSON'S APARTMENT - LIVING AREA - DAY

He hangs up the phone, and takes a deep breath.  He is in
a state of extremely jangled nerves.  He pours a giant
coffee, praying Angelica will stay in the bedroom as he
channel-surfs on all five TVs, stopping on a hot dog
commercial.

Catching a good one, he switches sets to the same
channel.  Braces himself as she enters, wearing undies.

                 NELSON
       Us.  Right.  Hey -- isn't there
       some kinda limit on 'us' talks?
       You know, one okay, two if
       necessary, three, cruel and
       unusual.

He flashes a smile and bolts, evading her once again.

Nelson re-enters the closet and finishes dressing,
obsessed.

He did.

                 NELSON
       Good dog, great dog...

                 ANGELICA
       You forgot about my parents,
       didn't you?

                 NELSON
       I can't make it.  I'm sorry.

                 ANGELICA
       Nelson, this is their third trip
       to the city.  This is important to
       me.

                 NELSON
       And this account is very important
       to me.

            (sees how hurt she
             is)
       Come on, it's Doctor Diggety,
       it's practically an American
       institution.
            (stops)
       Hey -- does that play?  American
       institution --

                 ANGELICA
       Stop it -- you know there are
       actually people who don't work 24
       hours a day.  They stop.  Relax.
       Have lives.

Dressed in chic clothes, Nelson grabs his suitcase.

                 NELSON
       Yeah, and I'm late for mine.

He rushes out, the door slamming shut behind him.

INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

Sleepy Madison Avenue types surround Nelson, wide awake
as he talks on his cell phone.

                 NELSON
       -- Look, I'm not sure I like the
       tagline anymore, it's working too
       hard, needs to be deadpan.  I
       wanna play with it for a few
       hours --

            (over phone)
       Cut it out, man, copy's good.
       Apply the 'If it ain't broke'
       rule.

INT. JABE & DUNNE - DAY

The elevator opens onto an advertising agency, abuzz with
activity.  Nelson is met by VINCE HOLLAND (36).  Walking
side-by-side, both men continue talking into their
phones.

                 NELSON
            (over phone)
       That rule applies to mediocrity.
       We want perfection.

                 VINCE
            (over phone)
       What we want is a check, Nelson.
       And bonuses.  And promotions.
       You worry too much.

                 NELSON
       I worry because worrying about
       losing keeps you winning.

Suddenly aware of themselves, they pocket their phones as
an OFFICE MANAGER hands Nelson an advertising award.

                 OFFICE MANAGER
       Congrats, Nelson.  You got the Ad
       Age for the Pelican spot.

Unimpressed, Nelson starts to hand the award to his
secretary, BEATRICE (23) -- when Vince plucks it away.

                 VINCE
       You'll hide it like all the
       others.  Whereas I'll take it and
       put it where it belongs.  Over my
       bed.

Nelson picks up a stack of trades as he blows by
Beatrice's desk on the way into his office.  Vince
follows him in.

                 BEATRICE
       Good morning, Mr. Moss.  Vince.

Greeting her, Nelson ignores Beatrice.  Vince flirts.

            NELSON AND VINCE
       Morning, Beatrice.

INT. JABE AND DUNNE - NELSON'S OFFICE - DAY

A temple of California corporate cool, the place looks
like a hip playpen for a kid who never grew up.

Nelson immediately settles down to work, furiously typing
new copy into his computer as Vince nervously peers over
his shoulder to observe the changes, wants to distract
him, change subject.

                 VINCE
       Hey, did you hear?  Edgar Price is
       coming out of retirement.  Says
       everybody's ripping him off; might
       as well get back in the game and
       rip himself off.

                 NELSON
       Edgar Price, huh?  He's great.

                 VINCE
       Remember that Mercedes spot he
       did... a trillion years ago?
            (folds hands together
             as if in prayer)

       Genius.

                 NELSON
       Yeah, well maybe a trillion years
       from now some guy will say the
       same about you.  If you get off
       your butt and work on this tag.

The door opens and their boss, RAEFORD DUNNE, pokes his
head in.  He is as anxious as Vince and Nelson about this
account.

                 DUNNE
       How's my dream team?  Got it
       locked up?

                 NELSON
       Sure, chief.  Just finessing
       some --

                 VINCE
       Minor details.  Minor.

INT. JABE AND DUNNE - ART DEPARTMENT - DAY

11A

Nelson and Vince are walking into an art department.

                 VINCE
       Can't wait to show you these
       boards -- I mean, they came out
       great, perfect.  The best work
       I've ever done -- of course with
       your help --
            (pauses)
       Client's gonna love 'em.

By now they are inside the room and Nelson is quickly
surveying a set of storyboards which we don't see.  He
jabs a finger as he indicates each one, all business.

                 NELSON
       Make this night.

       Nelson --

                 VINCE

                 NELSON
       Give me a bonfire.

                 VINCE
       Nelson, stop --

                 NELSON
       Make this three quarter.
            (points to another
             board)
       Nastier.  Give me more cleavage,

Just then, Beatrice enters the room, relieved to find
Nelson there.

                 BEATRICE
       There you are.  Did you forget
       your one o'clock at the D.M.V.?

                 NELSON
       Sort of.  Reschedule.

                 BEATRICE
       The deadline to renew is today.

                 NELSON
       So let it expire.

                 BEATRICE
       It was expired when you got the
       ticket.  That's why you have to go.

                 NELSON
       Beatrice, I don't have time for
       this.  Wait till the
       presentation's over...

                 BEATRICE
       If you don't renew today, they'll
       suspend your license, which means
       the next time you get pulled over,
       they can throw you in jail.  And I
       bet you don't have time for that,
       either.

A hush falls over the room.

                 VINCE
       Nobody beats the D.M.V., Nels.
       Not even you.

Annoyed beyond belief, Nelson waits as a PROCTOR passes

       There'll be no talking, eating,or
       drinking.  If your personal
       hygiene becomes a distraction,
       you will be asked to leave --

Running late, SARA (25), stumbles into the room.  At the
same time, the paper bag in her arms ruptures, spilling a
motley assortment of groceries.  She gets down on her
hands and knees starts picking them up, reaches for a
salami log under Nelson's chair...

                 PROCTOR
       If you need to go to the bathroom,
       raise your hand.

                 SARA
       Can you just pass me the
       Columbo...

       bathroom.

Nelson reaches for the salami, hands it to her.

       Here you go.

                 PROCTOR
       If you do not come back from the

test.

       Number nine.  True or false?

       What?  You wonder why?  What?

She's too ethical to rat, too annoyed to let him off the
hook.

       ... talking to me.

                 PROCTOR
       Bring your test forward!

Sara reluctantly approaches the Proctor, who takes her
test.

                 PROCTOR
       You may retake the test in 30
       days.

                 SARA
       What?!  30 days!  That's a long
       time -- that's so unfair!  I
       wasn't doing anything --

The immovable Proctor grimly shakes his head, points to
door.  Steaming, Sara returns to her desk.  Gathering her
things, she glares balefully at Nelson, who pretends not

       No, he said it's fine.

                 NELSON
       Cut him.  Get Johnson McDonald,
       give him the sample, he'll know
       what I want.

Just then he notices Sara sitting on the hood of his brand
new Mercedes, she gives him a jaunty wave.

                 SARA
       How'd the test go?  Hope you
       passed.

He ignores her for a moment, something has caught his eye
-- a beaten-up van with yapping dogs painted on it and
the words:  'BARKING MAD DOG GROOMERS AND DAY CARE.
Sanity in a dog-eat-dog world.'  It is parked next to his
Mercedes.

                 NELSON
            (into phone)
       Hey, Vince, what about this?
       'Barking mad for Doctor Diggety.

       right.  This is how you make --

He reaches for his wallet.

       Oh, shit, right.  Well, how much do
       you make?  Doesn't look like much.
       I'll cover your expenses --

       Here, call my secretary, she'll
       take care of it --

She takes the card, peers quizzically at it.

                 SARA
       Is this quest for redemption
       coming from true remorse, or are
       you just worried that my sitting
       on your car will leave a big dent?

                 NELSON
       The dent, I guess.

                 SARA
       That's what I thought.

There's a flicker of recognition in her eyes, as if she
has confirmed something in her own mind.  He gestures to
her -- get up.  She doesn't budge.  Annoyed, he reaches
in his wallet and shoves a hundred dollar bill at her.

Nelson works out at an intense pace on an treadmill as

       What is it?  It's a hot dog.  It's

Opening the oven, he grabs a hot dog, nearly burns his
hand.

                 NELSON
       It's a hot dog.
            (eureka)
       That's right!  It's a hot dog!
       It's a hot dog!

He cuts it and jabs a piece on a fork, just as the INTERCOM
BUZZES.  As he speaks he stares at the hot dog on fork.

       Yeah?

                 NELSON

                 MANNY (V.O.)
            (over intercom)
       Mr. Moss, this is Manny downstairs,
       I gotta bit of a situation here.  A
       certain lady, she says...
            (whispers,
             embarrassed)
       Some very strange and personal
       things about you.

Nelson still stares at the hot dog on fork, transfixed.

Nelson hears SCUFFLING sounds filter over the INTERCOM.
Then Sara's voice wafts up, honeyed and seductive.

                 SARA (V.O.)
       Hey, big spender, come down here.
       I can't stop thinking about you.

Nelson's bewildered, and intrigued.  Checks his watch,
mutters:

       Ten minutes.
            (presses "talk")

In sweats, Nelson comes out of the elevator.  Sara is busy
listening to a besotted MANNY tell her his whole life
story.

                 MANNY
       -- And then my ex-wife, she say
       you can't fix nothing, Manny, and
       she leaves me for plumber --

Sara finally notices Nelson approaching, flashes a smile.

                 SARA
       Look at that, Manny.  My very own
       Prince Charming.
            (to Nelson)
       I don't think I've ever met such a
       royal asshole in my whole life.

Nelson stops in his tracks, staggered.  She is off on a

                 SARA

       I'm smart.
            (pauses)
       And I need a ride.

                 NELSON
       This is a joke, right?

             head)
       You want a ride -- from me?

                 SARA
       Yep.  Face it, it's your fault I
       can't drive.  The least you can
       do is schlep me somewhere.  It's
       quick, painless --

                 NELSON
       I am not a schlepper.

Manny knocks on the glass from the inside and holds up a
handwritten sign that reads, "You want me call police?"
Nelson shakes his head.  Turns back to Sara.

                 NELSON

He makes a gesture, cutting her off, heads toward the

       Maybe you can help?  This man --
       he's your neighbor, right -- has
       been standing naked in his window
       flashing his ass at me and I want
       him to stop --

                 NELSON
       Ignore her, please.

As the flustered couple scurries inside, Sara stops a
young woman on her way out.

                 SARA
       Hi, how are you?  We've got a case
       of vodka and a bathtub full of
       fudge upstairs, would you like to

The picture of displeasure, Nelson drives.  Sara checks

charm -- completely throwing him yet again.

       It's so nice of you to do this for

Sara snatches the keys out of the ignition.

Deliberately chaotic, Sara's loft includes the fire pole
from the old station and plants galore.  As the puppies
carouse in a pen, Sara sets two teacups on the kitchen
table, where Nelson is sitting, aware of the fact that
she is openly checking him out.  He tries to strike a
nonchalant pose.

       I can help you, Nelson.  I have a

Thinking this is a seduction tactic, he plays along.

At the end of a long table, Raeford Dunne sits next to

occupy the other.  Leach's face does not betray one
emotion as he listens to Nelson's presentation.

On the wall, white sheets of paper cover boards underneath.
Nelson is at the top of his game, a consummate showman.  He
is so amped up, he's practically throwing off sparks.  He
holds up a board with an image on it -- a silly looking
50's style hot dog cartoon figure -- Doctor Diggety.

       This is your brand image, Mister
       Leach -- we polled your primary
       demographic and you know what
       eighty-nine percent said:
       boring.  Safe.  We need to drop
       a bomb.

            (dropping the board)
       We don't want hot dogs safe.

            (working up a
             head of steam)
       What's in a hot dog?  Don't tell
       me!  I don't wanna know...

He rips down a white sheet of paper to reveal an image of
a hot dog engulfed in flames:  the hot dog from hell.

                 NELSON
       They're dangerous!
            (pauses)
       What are we selling here?  We're
       selling temptation -- desire --
       animal instincts -- gluttony --
       sin.  We want to show man as he
       really is... a savage... he needs
       fire, he needs food.  He hunts
       and gathers, what does he get?

Rips down another sheet of what looks like a cave man
cooking hot dogs on a grill, his family of savages
huddled behind him.

       He gets a hot dog!
            (pauses)
       We're pagans, we love our rituals
       -- our team hits the ball out of
       the park, we're screaming, we're
       insane.  What do we want?

Rips down another sheet of a crowd at baseball game pitched
forward screaming like monsters, all holding hot dogs.

                 NELSON
       We want a hot dog!
            (pauses)
       Let's go straight to your pre-teen
       demographic.  Kids.  The little
       angels.  They're not angels.
       They're monsters.  You give them
       a tuna sandwich.  They don't want
       a tuna sandwich...
            (rips down another
             sheet)
       They want a hot dog!

Board showing a little boy glumly holding up a tuna
sandwich and an apple, lusting after the hot dog in the
hands of a cute girl next to him.  Nelson rushes over to
another sheet.

                 NELSON
       We need women.  We've got the
       mothers, we need their daughters.
       Let's answer that age old question
       -- what does a woman really want?
       You know.  I know --
            (rips sheet exposing
             another board)

       She wants a hot dog!

He is like some rabid animal, all fired up.

                 NELSON
       We're hot blooded -- we need sex.
       We need a sinful, dangerous food.
       What is it?
            (rips another sheet)
       It's a hot dog!  It's a hot dog!

He goes to the last sheet and rips it down.  A picture
of a total babe in devil costume, all bright reds and
cleavage, holding a pitchfork, a hot dog impaled on the
prong.  The gates of hell sizzling overhead.  The words:
"DOCTOR DIGGETY.  IT'S A HOT DOG" at bottom.  Nelson
pauses for dramatic effect.

                 NELSON
       Doctor Diggety.  It's a hot dog.

There is a long pause as Nelson catches his breath and
everyone in the room turns to Leach to hear his reaction.

            MR. LEACH

       No.

                 NELSON
            (taken aback)
       No.  What do you mean?

                 MR. LEACH
       It's not for us.  You don't
       understand our company.

                 NELSON
       I don't understand?  What did you
       ask for?  Edge.
            (points)
       This is edge.

Not even willing to deal with Nelson, Leach turns to
Raeford Dunne, as he prepares to leave.

                 MR. LEACH
       We'll be going with Baker, Bohanen.

He gestures to his team, they rise, start to leave.
Nelson starts to snap.

                 NELSON
       Excuse me.  I think you're making
       a big mistake.

       Nelson --

                 DUNNE

Nelson grabs a sales chart, holds it up.

He keeps moving toward the door, and Nelson finally snaps.

                 NELSON
       Were.  You're a dinosaur.  You're
       flatlining.  You're dead meat.

             furious)
       You just went too far, you little
       punk.  I'm gonna tell you what I
       really think of your campaign.
       It's cheap, tasteless crap.

       Well that's funny, 'cause so is

                 DUNNE
       Nelson, I'm warning you --

As Leach's minions hustle him out of the room, Vince and
two other ad guys hold Nelson back.  He shouts to Leach's
departing figure.

                 NELSON
       It's toxic waste in a tube!

The door opens and Nelson enters, instantly deflating.
He's very relieved to find Angelica emerging from the
bedroom.

She crosses toward the door, past him.  He is shocked.

                 NELSON
       This is not a good time for this,
       Angelica.

                 ANGELICA
       Hard to believe but it's not your
       call, Nelson.  I just finally
       realized... I can't stay
       involved with a man who doesn't
       even know he's not involved.
            (awkwardly)
       So I guess this non-relationship
       is officially a non-relationship.

All her efforts to be cool are cracking.  She looks away,
pushing the corners of her eyes, trying to stop a tear.

                 ANGELICA
       I tried to get close to you.  I
       did.

            (panicking)
       Wait -- please -- whatever I did --
       or said, I didn't mean, I'll be
       better --

She knows he's lying, that's even more humiliating to
her.

                 NELSON
       Please -- don't go.

                 ANGELICA
       I'm not staying just because you
       don't want to be alone.

She exits, leaving Nelson alone in the silent penthouse.
He approaches his display of glass and ceramics and
stares at them blankly.  Then, with a sudden, violent
swipe, Nelson sends the entire collection crashing.
Someone KNOCKS on the door.

Nelson wraps a towel around his hand.  Opening the door,
he finds a tattered box.  Stamped on the lid:  NOVEMBER.
The box starts to move.  Horrified, Nelson lifts the
lid!-- a Jack Russell puppy has a ridiculous-looking
Halloween hat tied to its head -- dangling from the hat
is a key.

loft includes an office cluster and a large bed.  A key
turns in the door.  The door swings open.  Nelson stands
there looking like a disheveled madman.  He carries the
box over to Sara.

He stares at her for a long moment and then pulls away.

Nelson yanks on his clothes.

Pouring rain.  Wearing his suit with no shirt, Nelson
storms out the door.  Sara follows pulling her sweater
on.

                 SARA
       Nelson, wait a second!  Would you
       stop for one second?

He keeps going.  A few pedestrians gawk, but most keep
going.

Nelson pulls Sara aside.

                 NELSON
       I have no words to describe how
       totally whacked you are!

                 SARA

       the sack!

                 SARA
       Please come back.  I won't tell
       you what to do.  We don't even
       have to do anything.  Just don't
       go.

For a moment, Nelson's guard drops and his face betrays
how weary and shattered he is by the events of the day.
She slips inside the opening in the crack.

                 SARA
       Tell me what you want me to do,
       Nelson, and I'll do it.  Tell me.

Sitting on the bed, Nelson stares intently at Sara,
standing in front of him.

       Take that off.

                 NELSON

Sara pulls her sweater over her head, revealing the same
persuasive undershirt he saw earlier.

       That, too.

                 NELSON

Sara removes her shirt.  Exposed, she waits for Nelson to
make the next move.  Gently, he kisses her stomach.  As
he slowly works his way upward, a swooning Sara grows
increasingly breathless.

                 SARA
       Would you like to be my November,
       Nelson?

       Yes.

                 NELSON

Finally letting go, they meet in a deep, sensuous kiss.

Alone in bed, Nelson is sound asleep, jerks bolt upright
screaming -- a cross-eyed cat is gnawing at his toes.

He grabs the cat by the scruff of neck, ready to hurl it,
then guiltily peeks to see if Sara's around, muttering:

                 NELSON
       Nice cat... nice kitty...

Sara's gone.  Nelson abruptly drops the cat -- it streaks
across the bed and barrels out to the living area where
it is attacked by Ernie, the puppy.  Sounds of FURRY
FIGHTING ensue.

Nelson jumps out, throws on his boxers, momentarily
puzzled -- where's the rest of his clothes?  Grabs his
cell phone and heads over to a TV set surrounded by
plants and ferns.  He tries to turn it on, it doesn't
work.  Shrugging, Nelson lowers himself to the floor and
begins a practiced routine of situps as he punches a
number on the phone.

She throws a pair of jeans and sweatshirt at him.  The
insane CAT streaks past, SCREECHING.  Nelson almost trips
on it.

       Poor Sasquatch.  Catnip overdose.

       Clothes are clothes.  All they

                 NELSON
       Yeah, well, it's just that this
       body likes to be covered in its
       own clothes.

Sara grabs Ernie.

       I told you, I gave them away.
       I'll never lie to you.

Too defeated to fight, Nelson throws on the jeans and
sweatshirt.  The jeans are about four inches too short.
As he is getting dressed, CHAS (30) shambles through the
door, looks exhausted.

                 CHAS
       I slept three hours last night.
       Tried valerian root, melatonin...

Chas goes straight to the coffeemaker, pours a cup,
kisses Sara.

       You know what finally put me to
       sleep?  Jimmy Cagney.  Public
       Enemy.  Violence as a

Nelson staggers forward, too dazed to speak.

On the street, they pass two old-guard bay area hippies

unlocking the door to their bookstore, Christopher's
Books, with pictures of Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti in the
window.

       Hey, guys, this is Nelson.

       I don't care.  I don't read.

Diagonally across the street, a vegetable market.  The
vendor, a Chinese woman, wags her finger and shouts at
pictures of her family propped up on her Buddhist altar.
Sara gives her a wave and continues with Nelson a few
steps, where they encounter ABNER (10).  He wears a red
balaclava, practices balancing on one leg.  Seeing Sara,
Abner stops balancing and avidly follows her as if she
were the Pied Piper.  Nearby, a HOMELESS MAN rummages
through the garbage, incongruously dressed in the chicest
gear imaginable.

                 HOMELESS MAN
       Sara, can you spare fifteen bucks?

                 SARA
       Okay, now you're just being

Nelson puts a brake on, gasps.

Abner does a head-to-toe on Nelson, doesn't like the

Sitting on the sofa, floor, chairs, posed like perfect
little stuffed animals, are Society Lady's six beloved
dogs.  Immaculately groomed, heads daintily cocked, front
paws folded over each other -- they are glaring coldly at
Nelson.  Sara pats their heads as she clips leashes on
them.

Extremely put out, Nelson walks beside Sara -- each holds
three dogs on leashes as they head up a path.  The dogs
don't pull or tug, prance with military precision.

                 NELSON
       Always a thrill to explore new
       career possibilities.  How much do
       you charge for this?

       I don't do it for the money.
            (shouts to dogs)
       Okay, guys, ready to be bad?

All six tails begin to wag in furious unison.
Incredulous, Nelson watches Sara unclip all the
dogs from leashes and swat them on the rump.

                 SARA
       Raise some hell, fellas, and don't
       tell Mommy!

Suddenly, nothing short of pure canine bedlam is
unleashed.  The six prissy DOGS go insane -- race up the
green, YIPPING and HOWLING, fighting with each other,
rolling in the dirt, scrambling through mud puddles,
BARKING at babies.  Overjoyed, Sara runs with the pack,
clapping her hands and shouting.

                 SARA
       Bad dogs!  Bad dogs!  I'm so proud
       of you!

Nelson rolls his eyes, checks his watch.  Lurches back
when a wet, muddy pooch shakes all over him.

                 NELSON
       Get away from me!

Another dog barrels up to Nelson.  Desperate for a pet,
the dog leaps up, licks and slobbers all over Nelson's
hand.

Disgusted, Nelson yanks his hand away.  Sara shouts from farther
away.

                 SARA
       Be nice to Winston -- he's
       insecure -- needs a lot of

       Winston!  That's enough!  Come
       here, boy!

Winston comes running to her, throws himself on the
ground and lets her rub his back.  Sara looks up to see
Nelson storming off the green.

EXT. VAN - IN PARK - DAY

The van is parked near a hose.  Nelson sits glumly in
driver's seat.  Outside, Sara hoses off all the filthy
dogs.

61

INT. VAN - DAY

Nelson checks his watch again.  Peers at Sara in the side
mirror.

NELSON'S POV - SIDE MIRROR

She is radiant, clearly gets so much genuine joy from
what she's doing, she couldn't look more beautiful.

NELSON

in van:  stares, moved in spite of himself.  Feels like a
jerk for being so uptight.  She comes to the window,
breathless.

                 SARA
       Look at them -- aren't they
       incredible?

The dogs are soaking wet, shivering, waiting patiently
for Sara to tell them what to do next.

62

INT. VAN - LATER

Trying to be a good sport, Nelson awkwardly helps Sara to
dry the dogs with hair driers.  Winston starts to make a
move toward Nelson.

Sara smiles to herself, thrilled to see he's managed to
bend, just this little bit.

EXT. PARK - ICE CREAM STAND - DUSK/SUNSET

63

Sara is licking an ice cream cone, counting money as she
waits for Nelson to make up his mind about his order.
Her van is parked nearby.

                 SARA
       Thirty bucks, not bad for a few
       hours work.

Nelson's tempted to say something glib, but bites his
tongue.  However, he can't help but register a look of
pity mixed with horror at how pathetic the earnings are.

                 NELSON
       I'll go for the lemon sorbet.

She almost chokes -- the look on her face is not unlike
the one he just made -- pure pity and horror.

                 SARA
       Tell me something.  When was the
       last time you spent the whole day
       outdoors?

                 NELSON
       I think... when my parents
       dragged me to Alcatraz for the
       day, at the age of nine.

He gets his sorbet and they start walking up the street
together.

                 NELSON
       Now you tell me something.

       Anything.

                 SARA

                 NELSON
       What's so enlightening about what
       we did today?

            (as she peers at
             him, confused)
       Why is letting some dogs go wild a
       better way to live than my way?
       Granted, it was mildly amusing,
       but I gotta tell you, my third eye
       didn't open.

                 SARA
       These things take time.  You don't
       have time.

                 NELSON
       No, seriously, it's a question of
       values.  Why is doing something
       fundamentally trivial better than
       living a responsible life, boring
       as that might seem to you?

She is silent, he presses on.  His tone is gentle,
slightly teasing, but there's real truth to what he says.

                 NELSON
       And who made you the expert, the
       doctor, the guru?  Why do you have
       all the answers?

Still, she is silent.  He teases her.

                 NELSON
       Come on, show me your resume.

Just then, they pass a three-sided bus stop with a big ad
for "DIVINE PETS.NET -- America's favorite pet store."
Sara points.

                 SARA
       I used to own that company, Divine
       Pets.

Nelson cracks up, her timing as usual is brilliant.

       Uh-huh.

                 NELSON

                 SARA
       I did.  But after a while it
       wasn't fun anymore.  So I quit.

                 NELSON
       Was that before or after you
       toured as a stand-up comedienne?

Nelson stands there somewhat bemused as Sara comes forward
with a scarf, smiling.

                 SARA
       This will be good for you...

She starts to blindfold him with the scarf.

                 SARA
       ... Sharpen your instincts.

He laughs, oh goody a sex game, tries to grab her.

                 SARA
       Not those instincts.  Okay, this
       is the object --
            (as he grabs her
             again)
       Stop it -- I run around so you
       lose track of where I am.
            (as he's pushing the
             scarf down)
       Don't do that, leave it on --
       count to ten and try to find me.

She secures the blindfold and races off.  He pauses for a
moment, then:

                 NELSON
       One two three -- I'm gonna get
       you!  Four five six -- I know
       where you are!  Seven eight nine
       ten.

            (pauses)
       This is really stupid.

He starts to walk, bumps into a chair, takes a few steps
more, bumps into a table, a few steps more and he trips
over a stool and crashes on the floor.

       Ow, shit!

                 NELSON

She runs over to him, laughing.

                 SARA
       Oh my God, you're really bad, you
       didn't even get close.

                 NELSON

He takes a deep breath, has to say something.

                 NELSON
       Sara, you're not gonna be upset
       when I leave tonight...?  I told
       you, one day.

                 SARA
       Yep.  You told me.  And you're a
       man of your word.

                 NELSON
       Don't get me wrong, I appreciate
       what you're trying to do -- crazy
       as it may seem to me.

                 SARA
       That's me.  Just... crazy.
            (sweetly)
       What are you more afraid of?
       Spending two consecutive nights
       with a woman?  Or discovering this
       whole thing might not be as crazy
       as you think?

He is flummoxed for a moment.

                 NELSON
       Hard to say.  I've definitely
       never met a woman like you,
       though.

       Good.

                 SARA

He covertly checks the time.

                 NELSON
       So, maybe I should just hit the
       road.

                 SARA
       Stay for dinner.  I have your

EXT. SARA'S LOFT - DECK - NIGHT

Nelson and Sara have dinner on a plant-covered deck, lit
by strings of cheap lights.  Ernie is begging at Nelson's
feet.

                 SARA
       Mitch was my October.  He was the
       shyest man I ever met.  We focused
       on confidence building.

                 NELSON
       Was the patient cured?

                 SARA
       My treatment was a little too
       effective.  We had to terminate
       the month early.

                 NELSON
       What about September?

                 SARA
       There was no September.

Nelson feigns disbelief.

                 SARA
       I'm not a weirdo about it.

       August?

                 NELSON

                 SARA
       Paul was so sad.

                 NELSON

                 SARA
       Gay gay but very happy about it.

Nelson has to ask:

                 NELSON
       And you and all these guys...

Nelson gestures suggestively.

                 SARA
       Does it really matter?

She flashes the most beguiling smile.

                 NELSON
       I suppose attraction has nothing
       to do with it.

The smile just becomes more beguiling, meaning:  of
course.

       Why a month?

                 NELSON

                 SARA
       Long enough to be meaningful.
       Short enough to stay out of
       trouble.

                 NELSON
       You defy every law of nature
       I know.

       Good.

The sound of a MAN LAUGHING drifts over from another
porch.

                 SARA
       Listen... do you hear that?  What
       a wonderful laugh.

She cocks her ear, listening to the MAN LAUGHING.  Then
they hear a BABY CRYING... a BASKETBALL GAME down the
street, a DRUNK WOMAN SINGING like an alley cat.  A
symphony of SOUNDS:  lives being lived around them.

                 SARA
       Doesn't life just... take your
       breath away?

Once again, he finds himself so moved by her, he is
wordless.  There is a long silence between them.

                 SARA
       What's your secret dream, Nelson?

                 NELSON
       I'm not much on that kind of
       thing.

                 SARA
       Come on, everyone's got one.

He listens to the SOUNDS, and takes a leap -- lets
himself open up for a moment.

                 NELSON
       My father sold door-to-door.
       Vacuum cleaners, life insurance,
       for a while he sold plastic food.
       We were kind of the joke of the
       neighborhood.  And believe me, the
       neighborhood was a pretty grim joke
       itself.

                 SARA
       Where did you live?

                 NELSON
       Daly City, just up the freeway...
            (pause)
       Anyway, after dinner every night,
       my dad would shut himself in the
       TV room and listen to 45s.  Frank
       Sinatra, Tony Bennett.  For a
       year or so, I desperately wanted
       to be a singer.

She stands up and leaves the kitchen.  He seems torn,
debates with himself as he finishes the dishes.  Turns to
see Sara removing the last bit of her clothes before
slipping into bed.

Nelson surfing the net.  Bored, he starts to disconnect
when he thinks of something.  He types in:  "DIVINE

comes up and he reads.

Web site:  Next to a picture of Sara and a blonde woman,
who bears a striking resemblance to her -- the words:

       arousing.  But if we took a cab,
       we'd miss out on all this.

       Exactly.

                 NELSON

Sara studies Nelson, stiff and impenetrable once again.

                 SARA
       You know what this train is,
       Nelson?

                 NELSON
       You mean besides a buffet of bad
       breath and body odor?

                 SARA
       It's 55 lives.  All happening at
       once, in the exact same place, at
       the exact same time.  Imagine how
       much hope and lust and fear and
       love are in this car, right now, at
       this very moment.  Look around.

                 NELSON

                 SARA
       I dare you.  Look at someone,
       anyone.  That woman by the door.

A woman in her early 40s stands near one of the doors,
her head leaning against the window as she stares out at
the passing city with a distant, detached expression.

                 SARA
       What do you see?

                 NELSON
       Female, 32-45, primary household
       decision maker.  Watches 2.5 hours
       of television a day, spends 27
       minutes at the grocery store,
       values price over brand.

Ignoring him, Sara gazes at the woman with empathy and
wonder.

                 SARA
       I think she's a mother.  I think
       she loves her family so much it
       hurts.  I think she'd throw
       herself in front of this train for
       them if she had to.  And I think
       when she gets into bed at night,
       she makes love to her husband like
       he was the king of Egypt.

As Sara enjoys the fruit of her imagination, Nelson
reconsiders the woman, this time seriously.

                 NELSON
       I think she's got a dead-end job,
       a husband she can't remember why
       she married, and a kid who doesn't
       understand any of it.

Nelson's grim assessment rolls over Sara like a cloud,
darkening her entire disposition.

                 SARA
       Maybe.  Maybe it's worse.  Maybe
       nothing about life even makes
       sense to her anymore.  Maybe some
       days she wishes she could just
       quit pretending and end the whole
       goddamn thing.

       You want to go to the dark side,
       Nelson?  I can get there faster
       than you can.  Believe me.

Looking away, Sara takes a deep breath and then smiles
again, as irrepressible as she was just moments before.

                 SARA
       But what for?  We see the world we
       choose to see.  And I think my
       first choice was a helluva lot
       more fun, don't you?

As the train jostles and jerks, Nelson and Sara search
each other's eyes.

waiting patiently, holding a paper bag.

Abner approaches, removing his balaclava.  He's a cute
kid, just shy and awkward.  Nelson wants to make up for
yesterday.

                 NELSON
       Hey, Abner, you've got a face and
       it's a good one, too!

Abner giggles, as Nelson's PHONE RINGS.

       About time you said so... Hey,
       heard about Angelica.  Sorry, man,

       her, I knew she wasn't for you.

Nelson watches the other kids coldly survey Abner, as if
he's too soft for this event.  The tough kids are
showing off their remote-controlled sail boats:  Most of
them are simple, macho, tough -- they look like Mad Max
boats.

ABNER WITH KIDS

pulls his boat out of a bag and the kids start to laugh.
Abner's is a hand-made sailboat, full of whimsy and
invention, an eccentric work of art.

                 KID #1
       Oh that's really cool, not.

                 KID #2
       What is it?  Pokeman's dinghy?

The kids have gathered in a circle around Abner, they are
intimidating, threatening.  Becoming concerned, Sara
turns to Nelson, waves him over.

The Organizer comes forward, shaking his head telling the
tough kids to stop.  As he raises his arm holding a
starter pistol, Nelson spots a techie nerd packing up a
model submarine on a nearby bench.

Abner looks up at Nelson, who winks back.  As his boat
passes the others, narrowly beating the last two boats to
the finish, Abner grins from ear to ear.

       You're a man.  When you don't know
       who your father is, you're not
       very picky about your role models.

She stops, stunned.  A Circuit City man is standing
outside her building with a big box.

Chas extends a manicured hand, Nelson is trying his hardest
to go along with it, forcing himself to be hip, ebullient.

       Great, great, this is very -- you

            (gently)
       Feeling better?

                 SARA
       Oh yeah.  All gone.

       Chas told me it was your sister on
       the phone.  Why does that upset
       you so much?

She shrugs and heads over to the bed.  Throws on the
charm.

                 SARA
       Remember the part about getting
       naked -- we could do that now.

                 NELSON
       Don't dodge me.
            (sits down beside
        
 her)
       Talk to me.  What happened?

She freezes up.  Quite simply cannot tell him anything.
He is really surprised, and a little hurt.

                 NELSON
       That's not fair.  You expect me to
       be so honest, so forthcoming...

                 SARA
       But this is your month, not mine.

She sees how mad he's getting, leans in and kisses him.

                 SARA
       Never go to bed angry.

Aroused by the kiss, Nelson prolongs it, unzips her
dress, slips his hand inside, caresses her back.  Is
surprised to feel her stiffen under his hands.  He backs
away, studies her.  He sees what she's trying to hide.

                 NELSON
       You're not feeling well are you?
            (as she gestures
             evasively)
       Maybe we'll get naked tomorrow,
       tonight we'll wear P.J.s.

INT. SARA'S LOFT - BEDROOM - MORNING

Sara and Nelson sound asleep, arms wrapped around each
other, both wearing pajamas.  Hearing a KNOCK on door,
ERNIE starts BARKING insanely.  Pissed, Nelson lifts
his head, shouting:

ERNIE keeps BARKING.  Then Nelson hears a louder KNOCK.
Annoyed, he rolls out of bed and heads for the door.
Opening it, Nelson finds Abner with an old trunk beside
him.

                 ABNER
       Wanna buy some junk?

                 NELSON
       Abner, it's, uhh... a little
       early.

                 ABNER
       I think I can break the record
       for tallest house of cards, but I
       gotta buy 75 decks, so I thought
       maybe I could sell some of my
       stuff.

Awake, Sara listens as Nelson waves Abner in.

                 NELSON
       Yeah, sure... come on in.

ON NELSON AND ABNER

sitting on the living room floor as Abner pulls one
colorful, homemade toy after another out of the trunk.
Composed entirely of found parts, the hand puppets,
figurines and other toys are wildly original.  Believing
Sara is still asleep, Nelson and Abner speak softly:

                 NELSON
       Abner, what is this stuff?

                 ABNER
       I make my own toys.  It's
       cheaper.

Amazed, Nelson chuckles, but Abner takes it the wrong way.

       Never mind.

                 ABNER

Abner starts to put the toys away, but Nelson stops him.

       Why do you wanna set a world
       record?

                 ABNER
       I wanna be good at something.

As Nelson studies Abner, Sara listens intently from the
bed.

                 NELSON
       Do you have any brothers or
       sisters?

Abner shakes his head.

       Neither did I.

                 NELSON

Abner looks up at Nelson with a new sense of connection.

                 NELSON
       It's lonely sometimes, but you
       know what?
            (pointing to
             his temple)
       It makes you use your imagination.
       It makes you creative.  You're
       already good at something, Abner.
       This stuff is incredible.

Watching now, Sara smiles, as proud as she is touched.

                 NELSON
       Other kids just buy toys at a
       store.  All that takes is money.
       This stuff is ten times cooler.
       Abner, you're an artist.

The affirmation sinking in, Abner smiles as he picks up
a spider puppet.

                 ABNER
       They don't do much though.

       Really?

                 NELSON

Nelson puts his hand into a wild, red-eyed mad man puppet
and brings it to life with a silly puppet voice:

       I happen to do a lot, young man.
       Why just last night, I cloned
       myself and then ate me for dinner.

                 ABNER
            (smirking)
       I think I'm a little old for that.

                 NELSON
       Oh right... of course you are.

Nelson now sees Sara is awake, and they exchange a grin.

                 NELSON
       In that case, I'm sure you're
       also too old for this...
       raaaaaghhh!

Nelson attacks with the mad man puppet and Abner, his kid
instincts kicking in, flees.

       Aaaahhh!

                 ABNER

As Nelson and the mad man chase Abner and his spider
around the loft, ERNIE BARKS furiously.  Cornering Abner,
Nelson reaches out with the mad man puppet and taps
Abner's spider.

       You're it.

                 NELSON

The chase reverses.

       Raaaaaaghhh!

                 ABNER

Gaining ground on Nelson, Abner rounds a corner and runs
smack into Sara.

                 SARA
       No running in this house!
            (scary alien voice)
       Unless I get to play!

Sara whips Abner's one-eyed alien puppet out from behind
her back and chases after its creator.

                 SARA
       Ah-hah-hah-hah-hah!

SAME SCENE - LATER

as the game evolves, Abner and his spider puppet prowling
the loft.

Behind Abner, the mad man and the alien silently appear
in doorways and above furniture, but when Abner spins
around, they're gone.  Even Ernie scampers past with
Abner's wire dog strapped to his back, but Abner misses
it.

Finally, Abner outsmarts the grown-ups, backtracks and
catches them both in the kitchen, looking the other way.

       Ahhh!

       Eeewwwwh!

EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

In very high spirits, the three of them sit at a table
outside the coffee shop.  Abner and Sara share a banana
split.  Abner is horrified to see the waitress bring
Nelson a fruit salad.  Sara whispers to Abner.

A Porsche pulls up to the curb, LEXY, a lingerie model
in the passenger seat, checks out the street.

                 LEXY
       The movie starts in ten minutes.
       Maybe we should skip it.

A MAN jumps out of the car, says:

                 MAN FROM CAR
       Don't worry, babe, you'll get
       your cappucino.

Seeing Nelson, the Man stops dead in his tracks.  It is
Vince.  He whistles as he takes in the whole scene.

                 VINCE
       Ooooh.  Somebody went domestic.

Just then, Abner checks his watch, jumps up.

                 ABNER
       Gotta go.  Mom's home for an hour
       between jobs!

He runs off.  Vince edges a little closer to Nelson's
table, checking Sara out head to toe.

                 VINCE
       Okay, okay.  Wow.  Well, I guess
       it all makes sense.  'Mystery

       I'm lost!

       Um... Sara, Vince, Vince, Sara.

Lexy calls out from the car, impatient to leave.

       Show me the house where you grew
       up.

EXT. HOUSE (OLD NEIGHBORHOOD) - DUSK

A decaying working-class neighborhood; "for sale" signs
dot the front yards.  Nelson's neglected old house has a
"for sale" sign in front.  He balks, feigning
indifference.

She opens the front door, extends her hand to Nelson
who's like a spooked horse out on the porch.

He takes a deep breath, still balking, then gives in.
Holding Sara's hand, he enters and slowly wanders through
the empty living room... memories, images, and sounds
washing over him.  He is silent for a long time, then:

Now Vince is doing a little song and dance for Price.

                 VINCE
       Just so you know, I've got a
       couple clients in my hip pocket,
       some great leads for new accounts.
       So we come -- fully loaded.

                 PRICE
       You're not selling me a car,
       Holland, and frankly I'm not
       overly impressed with you anyway.
            (to Nelson)
       But your reputation precedes you,
       and if I have to take him to get
       you, I will.  This is my offer.
       It's good as long as we're at this
       table.

Clearing their plates, the Waitress spills a drink.  It
soaks the napkin Price is writing on and pours into his
lap.

                 WAITRESS
       I'm sorry.  I'm so sorry.

                 PRICE
       You know... we are what we do in
       this world, sweetie, and you're a
       waitress.  All that requires is
       that you bring the food and drink
       to and from the table without
       making a mess.  That's it.  So
       when you screw up something so
       incredibly simple as that...
       well that just doesn't say a whole
       helluva lot about you, does it?

Stunned, the Waitress carries the dishes to a nearby
wait-station where she breaks down and cries.

if to leave, he's pulling a tactical maneuver to make them
nervous.

                 PRICE
       That's right.  Smart man, Nelson.

Price writes the offer on the napkin.  Vince picks it up,
reads it, jaw dropping.  Price grins -- loves his own
sense of drama -- extends his hand to Nelson.  But Nelson
does nothing.  And Vince starts to freak.

       Mr. Price... my father was a poor
       man... embarrassed by his own
       life.  I swore I'd never end up
       like him.  I thought money and
       success would be the difference.
       But you're rich and successful,

to him.  In a thrift store nearby, a twelve-year-old girl
practices dance moves, peering at herself in a mirror.
Nelson absorbs it all, feeling something he's never felt
before:  part of place.  True contentment.  Love.  His
eyes roam up to the billboard which was being replaced a
few weeks ago.  A new ad is up.  It says:  LIFE IS

       Well then this is a really big
       breakthrough for you -- you can
       finally say things that you could
       never say before.

                 NELSON
       Sara, I know you're not feeling
       well, but I gotta say... I was
       hoping for a different reaction.

                 SARA
       We made an arrangement, Nelson.
       One month and not a day more.
       That was our deal.

                 NELSON
       Screw the deal.  I just asked you
       to spend the rest of your life
       with me.  Doesn't that mean
       anything to you?

                 SARA
       Of course it does.

Sara tries to turn away, but Nelson won't let her.

                 SARA

                 NELSON
       Then look at me and tell me you
       don't love me.

Sara's eyes fill with tears.

                 SARA
       Please don't make me do this right
       now.

She heads for the bathroom.

       Do what, tell the truth?

                 NELSON

                 SARA
       ... because of me.

                 NELSON
       What about you?  For God's sake,
       Sara, please just tell me what's
       wrong.  All I want is the truth.

       I can't --

                 SARA

Rushing into the bathroom, Sara slams the door behind
her.

       Sara?

                 NELSON

As he tries the door, Nelson hears her becoming violently
ill inside.

                 NELSON

Delirious and crying, Sara fumbles to cover the vomit
with a towel as Nelson bursts in.

       What the hell is going on?

He sees the key in the cabinet door, lunges toward it.

                 SARA
       No!  You can't do that!  Get out!

She tries to stand up and stop him from unlocking the
cabinet, but she's too weak.  Yanking open the cabinet,
he gapes speechlessly at over 90 bottles of prescription
medicine.  Sara weakly pulls herself to her feet.
Gathering a last surge, she angrily rips the shelves from
the cabinet, sending scores of bottles rolling around the floor.

Sara hurls bottle after bottle at Nelson.  He stands
there dumbly, lets them bounce off him.

                 SARA
       You just couldn't leave it alone,
       could you?!  You just had to know!

She turns to leave -- her body literally collapses and
she starts to crash to the floor.  Nelson grabs her, she
is limp in his arms.  He gently lies her down, panicking
as she grows increasingly faint.

                 NELSON
       Sara, talk to me...
            (as she doesn't
             respond)
       Please... just talk to me, tell

A bewildered Nelson sits in a curtained-off area in a
busy emergency room, being grilled by a DOCTOR.

Sara is conked out on a gurney, attached to an IV drip.

                 DOCTOR
       Do you have her medical records?

       No.

                 NELSON

       Who's her doctor, so I can track
       them down...

       I don't know who her doctor is.

The Doctor looks at him, taking stock of this shell-
shocked man.

       I'm sorry, I don't know anything.
       I called a friend of hers, maybe
       he...

He peers around helplessly, sighs with relief when he
sees Chas racing into the emergency room looking for him.

105

INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DUSK

105

While Nelson stands off by himself, feeling exiled and
helpless, Chas confers with a NURSE outside Sara's
hospital room.  Nelson can see her in a bed, unconscious,
hooked up to blinking machines and a web of IV's.  Nelson
slowly comes over to Chas, taps him on the shoulder.

                 NELSON
       I'm sinking.  Fast.

Chas and the Nurse exchange a look.  The Nurse goes in
the room to check on Sara's vitals.

                 CHAS
       I'm sorry you had to find out this
       way, Nelson.  She was diagnosed four
       years ago.  It's a non-Hodgkins
       lymphoma.

Nelson is stunned.

                 CHAS
            (shakes his head)
       Come on, let's get a drink.

Nelson and Chas share a booth.  Nelson has left his drink
untouched, is desperately pumping Chas for information.

       stopped her treatments --
            (astonished)

       For Christ's sake, bone marrow
       transplants, chemo, experimental
       treatments... She stopped because
       they didn't work.
            (pauses)
       Nothing worked.

Nelson finally takes a gulp of his drink to brace
himself.  Tries to be brave.

                 NELSON
       Look, I'm no doctor... but one
       year unchecked...

Chas holds a clear honest gaze on Nelson

                 CHAS
       It has spread everywhere.

Nelson inhales sharply, like someone kicked him in the
stomach.  He is struggling not to cry and puts so much
energy into the struggle, he deflects the emotion to
anger.

                 NELSON
       God damn it.  Talk about trust --
       talk about honesty -- how could
       she get involved with me and not
       tell me she was sick?

Chas quietly sits there, lets him blow off steam.

                 NELSON
       I mean, what was she thinking?

                 CHAS
       She was thinking you'd be like
       all the others.  Just a month.

That stops Nelson.  Chas continues, his manner gentle,
calm.

                 CHAS
       You need to understand something,
       Nelson.  Rules are how she copes.
       When life's out of control,
       people go to great lengths to
       invent the illusion of control.

       rules?

            (as Chas is silent)
       Oh come on, Chas, I love her too,
       you're not betraying her.

Chas studies Nelson, nods.

                 CHAS
       Yes.  She saw what was coming, but
       they wouldn't let go, kept trying
       to run her disease.  So she took
       off.

       And came here?

                 NELSON

                 CHAS

            (nods)
       She told me since she couldn't
       live a normal life, she was gonna
       live an abnormal one, best way
       she knew how.

Nelson hangs his head, trying to collect himself.

                 NELSON
       I don't get it, she loves life
       more than anyone I know, how
       could she just... give up?

                 CHAS
       She's not giving up.  She's making
       the most of what she's got left.

                 NELSON
       But... I'm saying... she should
       fight it, instead of accepting...

                 CHAS
       Fate?  Why?  What's so bad about
       acceptance, Nelson?

Suddenly, all the emotions pour through the cracks and
Nelson just bursts into tears and cries like a baby.

       You want to know why I didn't tell
       you, don't you?

He sits down on the chair by the bed.  Nods.

       This is why.

                 SARA

She gestures to the whole set up:  the room, her in bed,
him standing there looking stricken, afraid to move.

                 SARA
       Look at us, look at you.  You
       probably think I'll break if you
       touch me, I'll crumble if you
       say one harsh word.  You measure
       every step, every thought...
            (pauses)
       That's not how I want you to be.

       Then I will learn to be better.

                 SARA
       Oh God, Nelson.  If anyone could,
       it's you.

She runs her fingers through his hair.  They are silent
a few beats.

       Will you help me do something?

       Anything.

down the hallway, Sara's knees buckle and he quickly
lifts her up, carries her the rest of the way to the
elevator.  The Nurse sees them get into the elevator.

       Oh, sweetie, let me take her...

Nelson precariously transfers Sara to Brandon's care.
Brandon barks an order to Chas.

       Get the donnetal and codeine.
            (to Sara)
       We've got a nice hot bath for you,
       baby.

Nelson watches helplessly as Brandon leads her into the
bathroom, where he and Chas remove her clothes.  Nelson
is so bereft, all he can do is stand outside the bathroom
and literally bang his head against the wall.

He moves to the doorway as they are lowering Sara into
the tub.  He can't help himself, has to say something.

                 NELSON

       door!  I don't want him here.
       Tell him to -- go!

Nelson can't move.  Chas comes out, gently pushes Nelson
out, closes the bathroom door behind him.

       I can't stand by and do nothing,
       just watch her...

       That's why she wants you to go.

Wearing an ill-fitting coat and tie, Abner pushes through
the front door.  Chas immediately slips back into the
bathroom and closes the door so Abner can't see.

       This is Nelson.  He's not my dad,
       but he does a lot of dad stuff,
       like he told me I should be
       myself, and it was cool to be
       creative.  And we made up a
       game called Dr. Shrink that

She has burned her hand, drops the tray and muffins splatter
all over the floor.  Chas immediately rushes over, concerned.

       It's nothing, just a teeny
       tiny little... ouch.

Her face is red and mottled from trying not to cry.

She stands up and throws some of the muffins into the
wastebasket.

                 SARA
       Stop it, would you?

She spins around to face him, eyes glittering.

                 SARA
       What rule says I should put him
       through hell?  All it will do is
       hurt him.

                 CHAS
       He'll hurt no matter what.
            (pauses)
       Maybe you should let him decide.

                 SARA
       My life is not his decision.

She turns her back on him, needs to compose herself.

                 SARA
       You shouldn't keep Brandon
       waiting.

He nods and starts to head out, stops.

                 CHAS
       Let yourself have some happiness,
       honey.  You're entitled.

The table is set with a motley collection of mismatched
plates and silver, decorated with Abner's puppets.  The
feast is laid out for Brandon, Chas, Abner, Al and
Osiris.  Al raises a glass of wine in toast.

                 AL
       Happy we-stole-your-land-and-
       killed-your-people day.

Suddenly, CHRISTMAS MUSIC BLASTS and Sara bolts up as
Nelson swings in through the window over the fire escape.
He is dressed as Santa Claus, carries a huge pack.

                 NELSON
       Merry Christmas, Sara!

                 SARA
       You mean, Thanksgiving.

                 NELSON
       Not for you.  You shouldn't have
       to wait.

Astonished and moved, all of Sara's friends make a move
to leave.

                 CHAS
       Maybe we'll grab a turkey pot pie
       at the coffee shop.
            (pauses)
       Nice to see you, Nelson.

Nelson nods, watches all of them leave, then turns back
to Sara.  He regards her with such tenderness, she is
struck speechless.  He unties his big bag.

                 NELSON
       For you, sweet Sara, I bring the
       twelve gifts of Christmas.

As Nelson describes each gift, he removes it from the
pack and hands it to Sara, beginning with a big salami.

                 NELSON
       One:  The famous Columbo log.
       The salami that started it all.
            (digs out another
             gift -- wigs)
       Two:  A kaleidoscope of coiffures
       for the Barking Mad Pet Crusader.

He plops a wig on her head and returns to his bag.

                 NELSON
       Three:  A bullwhip for the dizzy
       dominatrix.  So you can rule your
       world in style, and whip me into
       shape.

He cracks the whip, and Sara shrieks.

                 NELSON
       Four:  'Sara,' a custom-made
       fragrance capturing that special
       something a woman leaves on a man.

He opens the bottle and passes it under her nose.

       Oh, Nelson.  This is...

                 NELSON
       ... only the beginning.  Five:
       Why Is Harriet So Hairy?, the
       definitive guide to understanding
       our transvestite friends.
            (another gift)
       Six!  Tiny Bubbles -- for those
       leisurely soaks we love so much.

He hands her the bottle of bubble bath, then pulls out a
plastic Muni train, shakes it.

                 NELSON
       Seven:  A hundred Muni train
       tokens for the the many, many
       great rides of your life.

He hands her the bus, then pulls out a C.D.

                 NELSON
       Eight:  A collection of music
       to swoon by.  Which fits nicely
       with gift number nine...

He grabs her and spins her around the floor as he hands
her some vouchers.

                 NELSON
       Dance classes at Mildred's Academy
       of Dance, guaranteed to get you
       off my toes in a week.

He runs to the door.  Opens it.

                 NELSON
       Ten:  For the gentlelady who hates
       doing the dishes... a dishwasher.

                 SARA
       Nelson, please, this is too
       much...

Nelson runs back to the door, reaches for a sack.

                 NELSON
       It's not enough.  Eleven:  Live in
       your loft, back by popular demand,
       I give you...

He shakes open the sack, out tumbles Ernie, the puppy.

Completely overwhelmed, Sara wraps her arms around Ernie
and kisses him.

                 NELSON
       And if this last gift doesn't
       prove how much I love you, nothing
       will.

On stage, Nelson, wearing a white dinner jacket and black
tie, sings "Time After Time."

directly to her.  Meanwhile, the diverse crowd goes wild
for the rare, unabashedly heterosexual performance.

INT. SARA'S LOFT - NIGHT

Sara enters and freezes.  Novembers torn from innumerable
calendars are everywhere.

Every reachable inch of wall space and half the furniture
are covered with the month.  Nelson walks up behind Sara
and wraps his arms around her.

                 NELSON
       Look around, Sara... every month
       is November... and I love you
       every day.

                 SARA
       But, Nelson... it's almost over.

Nelson spins her around to face him.

                 NELSON
       Who told me once that we see the
       world we choose to see?
            (pauses)
       This is our month and it never
       has to end.

                 SARA
       But you know that I'm --

Nelson kisses her lightly on the lips.

                 NELSON
       I surrender all attempts to control
       life, yours or mine.  I live for
       one thing:  to love you.  To make
       you happy.  To live firmly and
       joyously in the moment.  November
       is all I know and all I ever want
       to know.

Conflicting currents of joy and sadness play across

Sara exits waving her license, and Nelson wraps his arm

Nelson and Sara gently make love.

As the BELLS of the nearby CHURCH RING TWELVE ominous

of November but the last has been crossed off.  Kissing
Sara's neck, shoulders and breasts, Nelson doesn't see
her anguished face.

Nelson wakes up as dawn is breaking, surprised to see
Sara's not in bed with him.  He peers around, sees her
fully-dressed, pulling the Novembers off the wall one-
by-one.  Most are already piled up in her arms.

                 NELSON
       What are you doing?

Removing the last calendar, Sara opens her trunk.  Most
of the gifts Nelson gave her are inside.  She adds the
calendars.

                 SARA
       I thought I'd keep half.  I put
       the other half in your bag.

Sara drapes Nelson's travel bag over his shoulder.

                 NELSON
       Sara, stop this, please...

Sara crosses the last day of November off the large
calendar.  Then she tears the month off, revealing
December.

                 SARA
       It's time for you to go, Nelson.

                 NELSON
       What are you talking about?

                 SARA

She puts on a jacket.

                 SARA
       I made you agree to a month for a
       reason.

                 NELSON
       Because you're sick?  I don't care
       if you're sick.  The only thing I
       care about is you.

                 SARA
       Then that's why you should go.

       No.

                 NELSON

                 SARA
       You said you would stop trying to
       control life, yours and mine.
            (firmly)
       Now you have to keep your word.

She wraps a scarf around her neck, turns and heads toward
the door.

                 NELSON
       Where are you going?

                 SARA
       Out.  To give you time to leave.

EXT. SARA'S BUILDING - DAWN 

Sara steps into the dawn, trying to stay calm.  Suddenly
breaks into a run as if she has to flee everything.
Nelson careens out of the building in pursuit,
practically dressing as he runs, throwing a jacket on.

                 NELSON
       Sara!  Stop it!  Come on, come
       back!

The park is deserted.  Halfway through, Nelson catches
her.  They both gasp for air.

                 NELSON
       Sara, stop it.  Will you please
       stop this, I'm not leaving you --
       I know you love me.

                 SARA
       I do, Nelson.  I've never felt
       anything like it.  I never thought
       I'd have the chance and you gave
       that to me.

                 NELSON
       Then why are you doing this?

                 SARA
       Because it's starting to happen,

       It just doesn't seem...

                 SARA
       Just like I need to know you'll go

       deserve.  I want you to fall in
       love again someday, be a husband,
       have a family.

Nelson soaks up as much of her as he can.  Then
reluctantly, he closes his eyes.  Sara blindfolds
him with the scarf.

                 NELSON
       ... One, two, three, four, five,

Sara stands on her tiptoes and whispers in his ear.

yards behind him and waits at the foot of a statue.

       ... Twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
       fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,
       eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

Nelson steps forward.  Then, turning, he walks straight
toward the statue and arrives at the exact spot Sara
stood just a moment before.

Slowly, he removes the scarf.  Sara, of course, is gone.
All around Nelson, shades of the park emerge in the
dawning light.

Looking down at the scarf in his hands, Nelson smiles.
At the same time, dawn breaks, piercing the park with
glimmering, amber light.

Carefully wrapping the scarf twice around his neck,
Nelson walks out of the park and into the street, just
as a red Muni train slowly makes its way across the
awakening city, its empty windows aglow in the dawn.

                                FADE OUT.
